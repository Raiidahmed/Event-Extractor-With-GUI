What we do in the next five years will impact the next five decades.

It will be a place where cause, community, and creativity intersect. We will provide a space where people can meet, share common interests, and engage on issues of civic engagement, accelerated by pop culture. We will engage activists by melding traditional organizing programming with non-traditional programming, including salons, art spaces, screenings, social programming, and women’s workforce development. This convention will leverage the power of culture shift through skilling up and storytelling to create an empowered space of feminist momentum. This event will mobilize and unite movements for gender justice, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and environmental justice and bring thousands of participants to combine activism and creative expression among everyday people. When and where is it? The Women’s Convention will run from Friday, October 20, to Sunday, October 22, 2023. The location is the Baird Center in Milwaukee, WI. Visit  www.thewomensconvention.com  to learn more about transportation, lodging, and to find our feminist guide to visiting Milwaukee.How much does it cost?General admission is $350 per person—an amount that covers the full cost of entrance to the Women's Convention.

We’re continuing to build on the success of the 2022 Women’s Convention by hosting it in Wisconsin for 2023 & 2024. Wisconsin is a vitally important state in 2024. Referred to as the incubator for our country’s tribal politics, many pundits think that Wisconsin is one of the states that will be both a deciding factor in the 2024 Presidential election and one that demonstrates the deep polarization that characterizes U.S. politics. With strong organizing, Wisconsin is flippable and Women’s March has the ability to make an impact on the outcome of the election. Women’s March has been making strategic interventions in Wisconsin since 2022, through both mobilizations and electoral strategies. The Women’s Convention will continue that investment with those women and communities who are the backbone and future of Wisconsin. We know that Women’s March belongs to our marchers and that they are the ones that make a change in whatever place they call home. We can support, connect, and amplify what they are doing and can do in their own backyards.Who will be there?The Women’s Convention will bring together over a thousand everyday women activists, allies, movement leaders, rising political stars that reflect our nation’s changing demographics, and thousands of new grassroots leaders who’ve organized in their communities and taken to the streets since January 2017. We hope to make this one of the largest convenings of its kind, and a unique opportunity for everyday women and our allies—from all backgrounds, and experiences—to learn together, share expertise, and unite around collective goals and strategies.What is the program? What can attendees expect? We are developing a program of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, and intersectional movement building based on the input, ideas, and efforts of organizers from our grassroots movements. Attendees—regardless of prior experience—can expect to be inspired, challenged, connected, and educated. The goal of the Women’s Convention is for participants to leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills, and strategies for working towards a collective feminist future. Visit www.thewomensconvention.com  for up-to-date programming information. Want to submit a workshop or idea for consideration? Visit www.thewomensconvention.com Where can I stay?Women's March has negotiated a limited amount of discounted rooms rates at the Hilton and Doubltee Hotels, both across the street from the convention center.

We will have space to accommodate for observance and prayer.Will the convention be accessible for disabled participants?Yes! We are working hard to make sure the convention is inclusive and accessible. The Baird Center is ADA-compliant.

Staff and curators will be on site to engage in meaningful conversations and reflections about the exhibition. -﻿-At the Precipice considers the role of physical and emotional reactions in the era of climate disaster. Given the proliferation of dire headlines and a public response that vacillates between denial and fatalism, the exhibition explores the use of color, tactility, material, and data not to avoid or disguise the issues but to instead offer accessible entry points. Featured works utilize a wide scope of art and design methodologies to give shape to aspects of a daunting crisis as they interpret the real-world changes of rising temperatures, environmental destruction, forced migration, and the stark consequences of unsustainable lifestyles enjoyed by few at the expense of many. Included are works by Selva Aparicio, Morel Doucet, Zaria Forman, Luftwerk, Nathalie Miebach, Chris Pappan, Redemptive Plastics, The Tempestry Project (Chicago Collection), Migwa Nthiga, and Jean Shin. At the Precipice explores how it feels to inhabit an irreversibly damaged planet facing a precarious future and considers the purpose of art and design in understanding how our collective trajectory must rapidly change direction. The exhibition is curated by Colossal."
