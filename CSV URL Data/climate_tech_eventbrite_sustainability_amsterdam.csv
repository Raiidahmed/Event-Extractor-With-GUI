Delve into climate and energy futures and gauge the influence of disruptive climate change events on potential evolutions in citizen energy choices. About the WorkshopHorizon Europe ECOSENS-project.eu has created a workshop transporting participants to the year 2050. Join the 2050 Citizens' Committee for Energy Advice and work with others to develop recommendations for the European Commission on achieving a more balanced energy mix. After reading a 2050 newspaper reporting the extreme weather and “how we got here”, specialist and non-specialist stakeholders will delve into narrative and ethical arguments, explore trade-offs, and critically examine societal pathways and obstacles to a resilient energy mix.  The 3-hour in-person workshop will be very interactive, engaging group discussions, cooperative deliberation, and collaborative tasks.B﻿ackgroundAccording to the IPCC, before 2035 the average temperature on Earth is projected to surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists have warned that the probability of climate extremes increases with every tenth of a degree of warming. Innovation and disruptive climate events will have increasingly significant impact on both daily life and energy sources, with new evolutions in economic, social, and environmental factors driving energy demand. By projecting ourselves now into 2050, can we perceive more clearly what societal responses should be?  Scenario tools provide a context for exploring a range of possible future outcomes. They create space to exchange ideas and insights on how policies are shaped or changed in the face of new information. Join a range of fellow citizens as well as social science and policy researchers to look into our future and experiment with taking decisions that few imagine today.  Funded by the European Union.

Through a combination of theory and hands-on exercises, we’ll examine the various paths that can be taken to a cleaner, smarter and more caring fashion future. Together with a stellar line up of speakers and workshop hosts, we will collectively investigate the overarching goal of sustainable and circular fashion design. The program includes topics and methodologies such as local regeneration, material understanding  and craft, and remake & upcycle skills. Join us at NOoF's sustainable fashion and textile LAB for two fun and exploratory days with a group of like-minded individuals who wish to commit to a better fashion future!PROGRAM OUTLINEDay one:  What is sustainable fashion? What is the difference between circular and regenerative? How can the Fibreshed approach make a blueprint for the future of fashion & getting in touch with natural materials: working with your hands for craft methodolgies. Day two:  Upcycling through bio-based screen printing, 'remake' a bucket hat, and a Trashtalk from community visionaries Trashclub. E﻿XPERTS & MENTORSEvey Kwong [futurprimitiv]Evey Kwong is a designer and researcher whose practice evolves in the theme of craft-based technology by connecting with the origin of material cultures, people and place.Her works have been exhibited at the Museum of European Cultures [DE], HOW&WOW BASK IT! [Dutch Design Week] and U-JOINTS: Knots & Knits [Fiskars Biennale, FI]. fueled by her desire to promote crafts making, she collaborates with various institutions on design research projects and workshops. For the Design for Change Retreat, Evey will lead the workshop ‘Connecting Twines’. The earliest twine was made by twisting, untwisting and braiding lengths of plant fiber. Twine is most commonly used in textiles and basketry. The invention of twine is at least as important as the development of stone tools for early humans. Archaeologists have called the development of twine, which can be made stronger and longer than its component fibers, “the string revolution”.Pollyanna MossPollyanna Moss engages in local practices of crafts and explores their inherent narratives. Her work materialises subjective and complex relationships between humans and the environment through design pieces and video installations, which together provide a careful reading of the landscapes she investigates. Through her design practice, Pollyanna develops strong working relationships with multiple parties - co-ordinating and communicating through shared care for the environment, and the species that inhabit various local domains. For the Design for Change Retreat, Pollyanna will be presenting her project 'Shed and Heddle', which explores a 15km production radius for local regenerative wool blankets, in a scalable format. Helen MilneHelen Milne is the LAB Manager at New Order of Fashion (NOoF) and deep dives into circular & regenerative design research and education. She writes and mentors NOoF residencies and leads the circular theory classes taught at the LAB for schools, university students and companies. She has a BA in Textile Design (Woven Specialism) from Central St. Martins  and an MA in Contextual Design from Design Academy Eindhoven. She's particularly interested in embodied craft knowledges, connecting diverse practitioners and developing practical examples of circular design methods. For the Design for Change Retreat, Helen will introdcue you to the overall landscape of Circular Design methodologies in Fashion, and be present throughout the week for discussions, organisation, and your main point of reference from NOoF!

Simply that our most important task is to get off our present collision course. And who is there to tackle such a task? I think every one of us, whether old or young, powerful or powerless, rich or poor, influential or un-influential.”- E.F. Schumacher. First Annual Small is Beautiful Lecture:The Next 50 yearsOn the 50th anniversary of E.F. Schumacher's seminal work Small is Beautiful, the core idea of his work — a placed-based economy in sync with living ecosystems and social needs — is as urgent and relevant as it has ever been. To honour Schumacher's ideas and move them forward in our time of ecological crisis and economic overreach, we feel the time is right for a Schumacher-inspired center in the Netherlands. 		“An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.”With an emphasis on the actionable, we envision a physical transformative space, a LAB, where a diversity of individuals, groups and organisations can explore, build and further the new ideas, social practices, technologies and policies for building a new type of society. The center will draw on the special contributions of arts and culture, economics, ecological sciences, and personal development.To help kick off a wider public consideration of Schumacher NL, we are proud to announce that commons activist and scholar David Bollier will deliver the first annual Small Is Beautiful Lecture at the Kleine Aarde in Boxtel on September 14, 2023.  David is Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the Schumacher Center for a New Economics in Massachusetts, United States. De Kleine Aarde, as a contemporary model, breathes Schumacher's work.  Hereby, we cordially invite you to be part of  our common movement. The afternoon is an active invitation to help build Schumacher NL  and will offer room for dialogue, initiative building, and connecting . Please join us.

The focus will be on “Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment”. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day.

Based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library’s daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) – Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) – Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 –  Coffee Break 11.30 – Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) – Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups – shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) – SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults).

Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) – MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 – Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 –  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) – Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant.

This workshop is based on a scientific master narrative that has been used as a spinning wheel for a dynamic process involving public libraries in Västmanland County, Lund University, artists and local stakeholders, where it has initiated a process to reveal the potential of public libraries as arenas for transition and change.15.30 – Coffee Break15.50 – Panel Discussion and Closing:  CLIMATE ACTION: COUNT LIBRARIES IN!A panel of library leaders from around the world will come together to share and discuss the role of libraries as actors of climate empowerment.16.30 – Self-guided Tour of LocHal and Social GatheringM﻿ore information can be found on our website:https://www.ifla.org/events/ifla-wlic-satellite-meeting-2023-libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment/"

Remember why you started in the first place. Re-connect with what's gone well so far, where you're at on your journey, and where you want to go next.Week 2: Doubt + Blocks - practice sharing your doubts, difficulties or blocks out loud. Give them a voice so that they can be heard + seen. Once we bring them out in to the light or show them they're not alone, they'll feel like we can work with them better.Week 3: Flow, Energy + Motivation - learn about all the different ways people get things done (not just the way society tells you you need to be in order to be 'productive' and 'successful'. Explore new rituals, systems, ways of thinking that work best for you.Week 4: Money + Pricing - there had to be a week about money because bills need to be paid and we need to live and eat! Explore how you set prices, how you manage cash flow, how you think about what we need to normalise about money in self employment, and why earning 'what' matters to you.Week 5: Selling as You, for Who? - get clear on who you want to be selling to. Get happy with your own unique sell style. Figure out what kind of person would want to buy from YOU because they want to work with YOU. Discuss how you're currently reaching them and how you might be able to reach even more of them, even more effectively.Week 6: Rewiring your beliefs about how work works - take stock together on what insights you've learnt that are most important to you. Make note of the tools, reframes, perspectives and ideas that have challenged you in the best way for you to move forwards in your work and business. Leave with both a plan, and a deeper sense of confidence + self-trust in how you can create your own version of success.I﻿'m excited! Are you?FORMATOver the 6 week period we will create a container together that is confidential and non-judgemental. We will all be entering the space from different perspectives as unique individuals with various business types, set-ups and experiences, so an open ear, and open heart, and respect for others is mandatory. Each person will share only what they wish to share. Through shared vulnerability and a commitment to each other, we’ll create group trust so it will feel safe to go deeper into our experiences, lessen the grip of insecurities and struggles that block us from experiencing the work and life we want, and find new or renewed confidence and belief in ourselves so that we can unstick, and make things happen in our businesses.I will take you through group exercises and inquiries drawn from various coaching methods and 10 years of business/brand strategy experience. I will facilitate self-enquiry, group thinking, perspective shifts, exposure to other business strategies and models, and collective conversation. Whilst I will be offering a range of frameworks or exercises, I will be coaching you, not mentoring you (i.e. I won't be telling you what to do or telling you to follow set models). This programme very much focuses on reconnecting you to your own resourcefulness and answers, and tapping in to the collective knowledge and experience of the live group. There is no singular correct way to do self employment or run a business, and we will all have learnt and be learning different things along the way. The learnings that we will all share, will feed in to a melting pot of experiences, inspirations and ideas that will create a learning experience bigger than the sum of it's parts. It will also create a sense of not being alone in how you feel, as well as offering community and support in your journey and ambitions. DATES, TIMES & LOCATIONWednesdays over 6 weeks 10:30am - 12:00pm (NL Time) 13th, 20th, 27th September; 4th, 11th, 18th October 2023Stories, Sarphatistraat 14, Amsterdam (tea, coffee and mini stroopwaffels included)(You're welcome to arrive at the practice to settle in up to 15 minutes before we begin.

It is not for people who would like to become self employed, or people running large businesses. I heartily welcome a range of industries and professions, as well as a range of self employment experience, e.g. from having completed your first 6-12 months in business, to being 5 years in and feeling lost or wondering where you go from here. Please do drop me an email on hannah@takecoachingamsterdam.nl if you are unsure if it's for you and would like to ask any questions!T﻿he most important factor, is that you want to be here. You are willing to show up, be part of and contribute to the group experience, and open yourself to the wonderful uncertainty of what will be discovered and unfold.Although this programme will, at times, feel therapeutic, holistic and personal, it is not therapy. Whilst we set up a container that enables trust and honesty, we ask everyone to take responsibility for their experience. Please speak to your therapist if you are wondering whether it is right for you to take this course.TICKETS 500€ + 21% BTW for the 6 week programmeIf you'd like an invoice so that you can reclaim the 21 % BTW, contact me on hannah@takecoachingamsterdam.nl with your KVK and BTW details.Y﻿OUR FACILITATOR AND COACHH﻿annah Ray is a therapeutic business, career and life coach. After working as a strategist in the advertising industry for over 10 years, she decided to put her skills more in to people than ads, retrained as a coach and founded and grew her own coaching practice, TAKE.

H﻿er approach to coaching is in the belief that the person sitting in front of her is fully capable and much more resourceful than they think. She is not interested in telling you what to do, but in finding out what the right questions to ask you are, so that you can bring some tenderness to your blocks and doubts, allow yourself to dream and voice your ideas + ambitions, and then explore what kind of set ups or ways of working will enable you to make shit happen. As much as she works holistically, spaciously and with a considered manner, she is deeply practical and will lovingly challenge you to create your own plan of action that moves you back in to alignment and keep stepping in the direction you want to go.H﻿annah has extensive experience with running groups and workshops for the most garrulous of crowds in corporate settings, as well as patience, respect and space for the quietest of introverts and dancing creative brains.

We will free ourselves, connecting to our inner wisdom, our voice and the innate power of our hearts. As we allow the magic mushroom to rewire our neural pathways we receive a powerful spark of guidance, inspiration and clarity on our path.The pure magic of this sacred medicine brings forth deep transformation, healing and self-realization.Experiencing the magic mushroom as a beautiful doorway towards our essence and our heart's wisdom.We connect with others through presence. We expand together through plant medicine, sharings, meditation & visualisations, moments of silence, intense journeys and deep transformation.WHAT IS PSILOCYBIN ASSISTED THERAPY?Magic Mushrooms are the general name of mushrooms that contain psilocybin and psilocyn. Psilocybin is a psychoactive substance that acts on serotonin brain receptors resulting in changes of perception, cognition and emotion. It is a highly visionary natural compound with a long tradition of shamanic use and a close similarity to normal brain chemistry.The FDA granted psilocybin the “breakthrough therapy” status. Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic truffles and magic mushrooms, has been shown (in studies conducted by Johns Hopkins University, NYU, Imperial College) to be effective in treating depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms and OCD. 70% of participants who received psilocybin had a complete mystical experience. Two-thirds of the participants ranked the experience among the top five most meaningful of their entire lives (comparable to events such as childbirth or the death of a parent). One-third felt that the psilocybin trip was the single most spiritually significant experience they ever had. Psilocybin has also been shown to boost creativity and problem-solving skills.MORE ABOUT THE EVENT:Tapping into the personal and collective unconscious with the use of the magic mushrooms is an ancient tradition. Some historians believe that magic mushrooms may have been used as far back as 9000 B.C. in North African indigenous cultures. Evidence of mushrooms were also found in Mayan and Aztec ruins in Central America. The Aztecs used a substance called teonanácatl, which means ""flesh of the gods,"" that many believe was magic mushrooms. In the West, magic mushrooms began to be eaten in the late 1950s.IS IT LEGAL?The mushrooms that we use in our ceremonies are the magic truffles. They are non-toxic to the body and 100% legal in the Netherlands.The mission that I see for SHFT Happens is to mobilize key groups that have the capacity to empower more of the many:Companies: By working closely with organizations, I help design, communicate, and implement change programs that prioritize long-term sustainability, employee well-being, and positive societal impact.Mental Wellbeing Professionals: I support mental wellbeing professionals in upgrading their profession to meet the evolving needs of individuals and society. Through the integration of innovative approaches, evidence-based practices, and continuous professional development, we can better serve individuals in their personal growth, resilience, and transformative journeys.Individuals on a Personal Development Path: I firmly believe in the power of personal growth and self-transformation as catalysts for broader change. By empowering individuals to embark on their own growth journeys, I encourage them to become agents of positive change within their communities and spheres of influence, amplifying the impact of collective efforts.As we navigate this critical period of unprecedented change, I invite you to join me on a journey of transformation. Together, we can create a world that is sustainable, compassionate, and equipped to face the challenges of the future. The miracle we seek lies within our collective efforts to change ourselves."

The discussion, which involves Afro-descendant stylists, artists, and fashion designers with origins from countries with a history of Dutch colonization, intends to identify new meanings about widespread colonial dressing practices and body policies and the effects of colonialism on the individual/collective imagination and design practices.Insight, together with fashion designer and creative director Zinzi de Brouwer and publisher and designer Willem van Zoetendaal, into the Dutch Wax fabrics and the implications of its designs and messages produced in Holland and sold in Africa and its complex and controversial identity representation. These fabrics present images and messages that are like archives of meanings that tell of an ambiguous relationship linked to the European colonial period. Fashion designers and creative directors Semhal Tsegaye Abebe, Bubu Ogisi, and Zinzi de Brouwer will also highlight initiatives and design projects that reveal the richness of African textile heritage still little known in Europe today, and their connection with sustainability. Some of the topics brought to the discussion will emerge from a participatory workshop that Caterina Pecchioli will lead previously at CBK Zuidoost Broedplaats Heesterveld and interviews collected on these issues by Caterina Pecchioli and Roxane Mbanga between Amsterdam and Paris.The Roundtable is organized within the framework of Decolonizing the Gaze - The Colonial Heritage of Italian and International Fashion Design and Its Impact on the Collective Imagination a project by Caterina Pecchioli which proposes a visual and historical analysis of dress items, fabrics, and accessories from the Italian and Dutch colonial period that are preserved in the collections of the Ex Museo Coloniale in Rome and Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam. A participatory study that aims to bring the Italian decolonial perspective within a live European debate on the decolonization of fashion and culture and on the political uses of fashion and clothing. The complex relationship between de-colonialism, heritage, cultural globalization, and “Made in Italy” is tackled through a program of workshops and seminars with the collaboration of institutions engaged on the subject in Italy, Holland, Ethiopia, South Africa, and the USA. In the Netherlands Caterina Pecchioli is an artist-in-resident at the Thami Mnyele Foundation for the months of June and July 2023 to develop the Dutch stage of the project."
