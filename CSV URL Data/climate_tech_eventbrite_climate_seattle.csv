We have evening entertainment on both Friday & Saturday nights so you can fully enjoy the festivities without worrying about getting home or drinking & driving. A few important things to remember: 1.	Camping tickets are all-inclusive (minus the pub crawl). What does this mean? It means you get entrance to the Faire Saturday & Sunday, entrance to both the Friday night & Saturday night events, and camping space (Friday – Sunday). 2.	Camping tickets are *date specific* and *capped* at a certain number. We are working hard this season to avoid over-crowding. We want everyone to have a great experience.3﻿.  Friday evening entertainment is for 21+ only. Saturday entertainment is available for all ages.4﻿. If you are camping with a group, let the Camping Staff know when you check in, and they will do their best to accommodate your larger group to camp all together. F﻿AQ1﻿. Do I need a reservation? Our Camping Packages are all-inclusive for a weekend of fun and excitement at the Faire. Camping Packages should be bought in advance. Tickets are NOT available for purchase at the Faire. Camping packages are date-specific so choose your weekend!2. Can I park near my camp? You may park your vehicle in your camping area as long as it is not in the ‘fire lane’ and it is not impeding other's ability to camp. You may drive to the main site and park closer if desired.3. What are the ""Quiet Hours""?  Quiet hours start at 10:00 pm, so we ask that you speak in whispers and silence all things that make noise.This includes generators, drumming, loud music, and loud parties.4. What facilities are available? Our camping area is a large field and very primitive. There are no plug-ins, but it’s ok to use a generator during the daylight hours (6am – 10pm). We have porta-potties and a dumpster for your use. Please remember to pack out your supplies/equipment and garbage.5. Where and when can I check-in? Check-in for camping is on Friday from noon until midnight each Friday before the Faire weekends. Check-out is after the Faire on Sunday evening by 8pm. Once you check in on Friday, each family member will receive a bracelet which allows entry into the camping area and into the Faire site during the weekend and after hours. Please ask your family to wear them all weekend. They are waterproof, so it’s okay to shower/bathe in them. If you would like to check-in for camping on Saturday, please go to the Towne Gate (on the Main Faire site) and the Towne Gate staff will contact camping staff for help finding your camping space.If you are camping with a group, let the Camping Staff know when you check in, and they will do their best to accommodate your larger group to camp all together. ***NOTE*** If you have a bracelet, go right to the town gate for entrance on Saturday or Sunday. You don’t need to wait in the lines.6. Can I have a camp fire? What can I cook on? Open fires are not allowed on our site, per the Pierce County Fire Marshal. This includes, but is not limited to, wood & charcoal braziers, fire pits, tiki torches, open candles or any other source of open flame.

Home to the majestic Peace River, this region has been ravaged by more than 25,000 fracking wells threatening livelihoods, physical and mental health, and the very water that sustains the life and spirit of these communities. Fracking in B.C. is currently responsible for the majority of B.C.’s methane emissions. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is 86x more toxic for the atmosphere than CO2, and has been historically under-reported in B.C. Yet the fracking industry receives the single largest oil and gas subsidy from the B.C. government. Fracking the Peace paints a picture of how fracking development in B.C. has been allowed to skyrocket at the expense of the health and safety of watersheds, communities, and the rich agricultural landscape they call home.Fracking the Peace was created by Desiree Wallace in partnership with Stand.earthAre you unable to make the in-person event, or want to spread the word to friends and family outside of Victoria?

While we may not be able to spare glacial ice from the ravages of climate change, we can preserve what the Olympic glaciers mean to us.

The goal is to provide a visual timeline of each glacier's life and story and draw attention to the impacts of climate change on the park's ecosystems.To learn more, visit: Terminus Glacier Memorial project, where you can see the Terminus Art that has already been created with new works of art added weekly.

Since the Iliad--in which we are shown golden statues built by Hephaestus ""with minds and wisdoms""--humans have been fascinated by the idea of artificial life. From the Argonautica to the medieval Jewish legend of the Golem and Ambrose Bierce's tale of a chess-playing robot, the idea of what robots are--and who creates them--can be drastically different.This book collects a broad selection of short stories from celebrated authors such as Philip K. Dick, Seanan McGuire, Roger Zelazny, Connie Willis, and many more. Robots through the Ages not only celebrates the history of robots and the genre of science fiction, but the dauntless nature of human ingenuity.This event is free to attend, though registration is required through the link provided.

Registration is required in advance.About Set Adrift. . .In January, 1958, a renowned sailing family was lost in a storm in the Bermuda Triangle. The youngest of two daughters, Sarah, suddenly an orphan, grew up never knowing her parents and grandparents. As an adult, she began to pursue the mystery of her family and their disappearance, and discovered that their stories were far different from the versions she was told. Sarah Conover’s memoir follows the national media’s investigation of the Revonoc’s vanishing, and exposes the truths that led her to “unstory” the family history, creating a new understanding of their lives, and hers.About Interrogating Travel. . .Never in human history has travel been so accessible to so many. But—amid an escalating climate crisis that threatens the homes of vulnerable people across the world—has the human cost of trekking the globe become too high? Paul Lindholdt links firsthand narratives with research about the travel trade, telling stories of his reluctant voyages while arguing that carbon-intensive trips abroad may be offset if adventurers come to know and love the landscapes closer to home. Tourism may be the planet’s largest industry, but Interrogating Travel advises readers to stay mindful of the consequences of their journeys, whether visiting local getaways or some of Earth’s most remote locations.Sarah Conover holds a BA in religious studies from the University of Colorado and an MFA in Creative Writing from Eastern Washington University. Her poetry, essays and interviews have been published in a variety of literary journals and anthologies including The Sun Magazine, and she is a feature writer and columnist for Tricycle Magazine: The Buddhist Review. She is an award-winning author of six books on world wisdom traditions and spirituality. A recipient of a Washington GAP Grant (Grants for Artists’ Projects), she has also received fellowships from the Ucross Foundation and the Willapa Bay Artist in Residence program.

The Balance of Energy between all thingsLocated on a historic farm estate, Orenda winery blends rustic-charm with classic-elegance. Orenda is the perfect location for your event.Orenda Winery brought together three friends with a shared commitment—to build community and to bring Orenda to winemaking. We believe wine should maintain a balance between bold and subtle flavors. To execute this vision, we have partnered with some of the highest elevation vineyards in Washington state in both Yakima Valley and Columbia Valley. High elevation provides a cool climate with late ripening fruit. This allows the grapes more time to mature, making wine less bold and significantly more subtle than wines from warmer regions. When aged in small French oak barrels, the results are complex, dynamic flavors reminiscent of an old-world style rarely found in Washington wines."
