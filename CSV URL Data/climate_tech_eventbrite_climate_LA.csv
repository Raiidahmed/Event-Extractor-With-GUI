https://www.eventbrite.com/e/about-face-tickets-614600034247?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Artspace Warehouse,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/artspace-warehouse-29991587742,"artspacewarehouse.com@artspaceware Artspace Warehouse presents About Face, a thought-provoking group exhibition that basks in its flatness. Through a curated selection of works that are both physically and visually flat, this show challenges the viewer to consider the role of dimension and depth in our perception of beauty and form. Given the rise of high-quality printers and AI-generated art, flat paintings get misconstrued as artificially created and may even be considered of lesser value without the presence of the artist’s hand. Despite these notions, these artists have perfected their painting techniques, giving rise to a pristine flatness in their work, which can only be achieved with each artist’s individual aplomb. With an emphasis on geometry and color within his artworks, British artist Paul Westacott takes inspiration from the sunny California landscape to create his abstract paintings. The dialogue between color, form, line, and repetition is the vocabulary that explores visual relationships. The rainy climate of northern England where he grew up shaped his appreciation and captivation with the light and color of Southern California. When creating his works and choosing colors, he seeks to have the colors themselves inspire joy and transformation. In addition to being an artist, Westacott has enjoyed a career as a creative designer in the film and entertainment industries as well as working as a Disney “Imagineer.”Born in New York in 1964, Jodi Fuchs is an award-winning contemporary abstract painter living in St. Petersburg, Florida. Her education about color and pattern came on the job while working as a decorative painter for 20+ years in Los Angeles. Fuchs creates modern abstract expressionistic pieces that have an undeniable energy. Her medium is acrylic on canvas or panel, and she often uses spray paint, ink, and oil stick to enhance the work. It is Fuchs’ fascination with the pure creative force: understanding it, harnessing it, and expressing it, that fuels her painting process. Years of inquiry into the metaphysical aspects of life have influenced her studio practice. Experimentation is a central part of Julie Naima’s practice. Naima pulls inspiration from the magical places of the world, both real and fable, experienced in her travels and through her inner child’s imagination. From here, Naima imbues good intentions and positive emotions onto her canvas through her focus on color and shape. Her works are glimpses into her playful imaginary world where Naima invites the viewers to connect with the painting through their emotional response and answer the invitation to a dialogue about hope and happiness. Julie’s work can be found in private collections throughout Canada, Europe, Australia, and the USA.Will Beger's contemporary-minimalist paintings take on a new approach to southwest art. Influenced by his youth and inspired by nature, he effortlessly captures a vibrant, bohemian aesthetic that is unapologetically true to his inner child. His modern Southwest artworks feature a mix of mid-century modernism and landscape motifs with an emphasis on desert minimal design. Through stark contrasts between bold, monochromatic backgrounds and subject matter, Beger paints for himself, while also seamlessly connecting with anybody and everybody.Danny Brown is a first-generation American artist born in Los Angeles. Danny Brown’s artworks allocate an intrinsic connection between himself and the diverse communities occupying Los Angeles. Brown’s art coalesces youth culture, art history, fashion, and American consumerism and melds them all to create his unique style. Instantly relatable and recognizable, his cathartic paintings represent contemporary issues as well as a demographic that is traditionally underrepresented in fine art. Through his experience with graffiti, Brown became fluent in the use of color blocking and translating rougher imagery into something vibrant. His works speak to young Americans and inspire a whole new generation of art collectors and admirers.Combining her love for abstract art and the act of finding beauty in everyday life, local artist Courtney Simone creates cheerfully inspired abstract figurative artworks. Within her work, she walks the line between relatable day-to-day scenes and the fantastical. Her intuitive mark-makings and stylistic distortion of her female subjects marry the concepts of familiar comfort and discovery. As she creates each distinctive painting, she gives herself permission to explore and play with colors, subject matter, and composition leading to artworks full of joy and whimsy.Since the opening of Artspace Warehouse in 2010, the gallery continues to be an industry leader in affordable, museum-quality artworks making collecting art accessible and budget-friendly. With one gallery in Zurich and two galleries in Los Angeles, Artspace Warehouse specializes in guilt-free international urban, pop, graffiti, figurative, and abstract art. The expansive 5,000-square-foot space offers a large selection of emerging and established artists from all over the world."

In 1995, they released the Fuente Fuente Opus X, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest cigars in the world. The Opus X was created by Carlos Fuente Jr., who was inspired by the rich soil and climate of the Dominican Republic. He wanted to create a cigar that would showcase the best of what the country had to offer. The Opus X is made with a unique blend of tobaccos, including a rare Corojo wrapper that is grown under shade. This gives the cigar a distinctive flavor that is both complex and full-bodied. The Opus X is also known for its limited production. Each year, only a few thousand cigars are made, which makes them highly sought-after by cigar smokers. The Opus X has won numerous awards, including Cigar Aficionado's "" Cigar of the Year"" in 1996. It is consistently ranked among the top cigars in the world, and it is considered by many to be the pinnacle of cigar perfection.The Cigar of the Night: Arturo Fuente Destino Siglo de Pasion Opus X 100thThe Arturo Fuente Destino Siglo de Pasion Opus X 100th An is a limited-edition cigar that was released in 2013 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Arturo Fuente cigar brand.

The cigar is medium to full-bodied, with a strong peppery profile that is accompanied by notes of dark chocolate, leather, cocoa, and a slight earthiness. It has a long and lingering finish, with hints of spice and oak. And it is considered to be one of the best cigars that Arturo Fuente has ever made.History of The Macallan DistilleryAh, the story of Macallan, a tale as rich and smooth as the whisky itself, laddie. Back in 1824, it was Alexander Reid, a humble barley farmer, who laid the foundations of the Elchies Distillery, later to be known as the world-renowned Macallan. Passing from hand to hand, the distillery found its true purpose under Roderick Kemp, a visionary who saw the potential in Macallan's fertile ground and turned it into a revered single malt producer. Through the decades, Macallan grew, always cherishing the importance of 'terroir', even growing its own barley on their verdant estate. Its fame grew, not just as a contributor to blended whiskies, but as a premium single malt. Macallan's passion for quality extended to its cask management, with a fondness for Spanish oak seasoned with sherry, lending their whisky a distinct flavor and natural color. Come 2018, they raised a toast to innovation, opening a cutting-edge distillery that embodied their respect for tradition and the natural world. Macallan, in its essence, is a testament to quality, setting records and benchmarks in the world of whisky, just as yours truly did in the world of cinema.Showcased WhiskeysMacallan 15 year:This whisky is a part of Macallan's Sherry Oak range, which features whiskies matured exclusively in hand-picked sherry seasoned oak casks from Jerez, Spain. The Macallan 15 Year is a rich, full-bodied whisky with a golden butterscotch color.

This whisky is characterized by its rich mahogany color and exhibits a complex aroma with hints of dried fruits, ginger, and toffee. Its flavor is rich and robust, with notes of dried fruits, spice, and chocolate, leading to a lingering finish of warm spice and mature oak.Macallan Harmony Arabica:The Macallan Whisky Maker Steven Bremner and The Coffee Collective. The whisky is aged for 18 years in a combination of European and American oak casks that previously held bourbon and sherry. This imparts a complex and harmonious flavor profile, with notes of ground coffee, hazelnut, sweet raisin, and vanilla. The finish is long and lingering, with hints of spice and oak.Macallan Harmony Cacao:The Macallan Harmony Collection Rich Cacao is a single malt Scotch whisky that was created in collaboration with the renowned pastry chef, Jordi Roca. The whisky is aged for 22 years in a combination of European and American oak casks that previously held sherry. This imparts a complex and harmonious flavor profile, with notes of chocolate fondant, honey, oak, zesty lime and ginger. The palate is rich and creamy, with flavors of dark chocolate, honey, dates, vanilla and cinnamon. The finish is long and lingering, with hints of spice and chocolate. A Brief on the Don Carlos Reserve Superior Limitada, “The Mans 80th”The Arturo Fuente Don Carlos Edicion de Aniversario 80th The Man’s 80th is a limited-edition cigar that was released in 2014 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Carlos Fuente Sr., the patriarch of the Arturo Fuente cigar family.

Birdemic: Shock & Terror not only wears its love of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds on its cinematic sleeve (including a cameo from Tippi Hedren herself) but it achieves emotional reactions no other movie is really capable of.In fact, Birdemic was one of the movies I personally chose for Secret Movie Club when it was just a group of friends showing other friends movies they had never heard of that would make their jaw drop.AND TO TOP IT OFF, WE HAVE WRITER/DIRECTOR JAMES NGUYEN IN PERSON FOR A Q&A!If you’ve never seen Birdemic or heard about Birdemic, it basically follows couple Rod and Natalie on a romantic getaway. In fact this romantic getaway takes a large part of the first part of the movie.

But when you do, you will realize you have seen nothing like it.We’ll talk to writer/director Nguyen about how he made his micro-budget effects heavy horror film.

Potluck & Social:  Welcome to bring, but not required, a vegan/vegetarian dish to share for social after the Kirtan.

What is Kirtan: 
 Kirtan is the Yoga of Devotion (Bhakti Yoga). Derived from a Sanskrit root meaning to call, recite, praise, or glorify, put simply, kirtan is the act of praising and glorifying the Divine. 

Why Kirtan:  Chanting Kirtan is a devotional practice that helps to uplift the mind, open the heart and bring inner peace. It is the fastest, easiest and most joyful way to achieve peace of mind. The mantras are mystical universal sounds that resonate with our chakras and remove negative energies.



Parking:  Plenty of free streetside parking; or next door at MGM Building parking lot.

What to Bring:  Dress comfortable, we have plenty of cushions, bolsters, blankets, and folding chairs.

Schedule:  4:30pm - 530pm - SoundBath & Prana Lifeforce Healing

About Michael:  A gifted singer from his teenage years, Michael trained at the Drama Division of The Juilliard School, and went on to an award-winning career on the stage, twice honored by the Joseph Jefferson Award in his native Chicago for work in musical theater.

Leaving his acting career to immerse in meditation at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in California, he turned his musical gifts to a devotional mode, serving for 15 years as chant and meditation leader in the traditional kirtan music of India.

Two acclaimed CDs of devotional music followed, Adoration - Chants for Meditation, and Adoration 2 - Sacred Yoga Love Songs. Tours of yoga centers throughout the United States ensued, as well as an invitation to perform devotional music at the interfaith gatherings of The Global Peace Initiative of Women, at such events as The United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Denmark in December 2009, and The Conference on The Divine Feminine in Assisi, Italy that same year.

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bongzilla-tickets-635627718617?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Resident,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/resident-18722653542,"Bongzilla formed sometime in 1995 in Wisconsin, quickly composing a host of songs inspired by their marijuana. Very little is known about the early years of the band except for their appearances on a host of split and EP releases between 1996 and 1999, the first being Mixed Bag on Rhetoric Records in 1996. Following a split with MeatJack another 7"" EP entitled Hemp For Victory (Named after the vintage educational/propaganda film of the same name) was released on Thunder Lizard. Two more splits followed the same year and eventually Bongzilla was signed to Relapse Records.
The first release on this label was Methods for Attaining Extreme Altitudes released on CD on 27 January 1998. The band at this point made yearly appearances at the Milwaukee Metalfest, notably 1999 and 2000. The band's debut studio album Stash saw it's release on 20 April 1999 to positive reviews. A split with Corrupted, Noothgrush and Dystopia entitled Twin Threat To Your Sanity followed.
The band's second album saw release via Howling Bull America (With a reissue three years later via Relapse). Apogee was released on 11 May 2001 and showcased three new songs along with live recordings from 1998. A compilation of all of the band's EPs and splits to that point entitled Shake: The Singles saw release the next year. The band's third album Gateway saw release via Relapse on 3 September 2002.
Bongzilla would begin 2003 as part of the Relapse Contamination Festival, with their performance being released as a live album the next year. The band sporadically played shows and tours, with notable appearances at various festivals.
A lineup change prompted one Dixie Dave Collins to join the band as their bassist, leading them to record the band's fourth album. Amerijuanican was released via Relapse on 27 September 2005 to positive reviews and featured a cover of ""Champagne and Reefer"" by Muddy Waters. The band toured and remained active until 2009 when the group quietly took a hiatus, their last known show being Forward Fest alongside the likes of Bob Mould, Detroit Cobras and Neko Case to name a few.


In April 2015 it was announced Bongzilla was reforming with the Gateway lineup, first announcing a tour of Europe including dates at Heavy Days in Doomtown and Temples Festival along with a single date in NYC. The band followed up with a four-date tour of the West Coast USA, a tour of the east coast USA and an appearance at Desertfest Belgium.

Bongzilla began 2017 with a local show in Wisconsin before embarking on another European tour, playing the likes of Roadburn Festival, DesertFest Berlin, DesertFest London, KrisionFest (Their first ever appearance in Spain) and have begun working on material for a new album. Bongzilla have also set course for a 2018 European tour with Dopethrone and Sons of Otis. Bongzilla would tour and perform several festivals in 2018 and 2019. In late 2018 Totem Cat Records would release a 14 song compilation of the Bongzilla early split / live material under the album name Thank You Marijuana. In early 2020, Bongzilla started their own label called Gungeon Records and released a re-issue of their classic album Apogee. However, in March of 2020 it would be announced that Cooter Brown would retire from the band due to health and family reasons, with Bongzilla choosing to continue as a thunderous three-piece. During Bongzilla's first tour as a thunderous three in March of 2020, the tour was cut short due to a the coronavirus pandemic. A few months into the pandemic, Bongzilla began rehearsing and recording for several different record projects - A limited Wake Brewing 7 inch, a full length album titled Weedsconsin, an LP split with the band Tons, and a 7 Inch Split with Boris, the first of a 7 inch Split Series released on Gungeon Records. All projects were recorded at Future Apple Tree Studios in Rockford, Illinois in October of 2020 by the legendary John Hopkins before his sudden and unexpected passing in the late fall of 2020. Bongzilla announced signing to the Italian label - Heavy Psych Sounds on Janurary 21st of 2021. Bongzilla is preparing for the release of their new full length album Weedsconsin, as well as a limited 7 Inch from Wake Brewing, followed by the Bongzilla / Tons Split for the HPS series - Doom Sessions, as well as the 7 inch split with Boris that will come out on Gungeon Records. All releases are scheduled to drop in 2021.  

W﻿ebsite-﻿-----------------------------K﻿adabraIn 2020, a year wrecked with cultural dissent and a global pandemic, fellow musicians and long-time friends Garrett Zanol and Ian Nelson decided to create a band that would pull influence from a few of their favorite musical acts. After retaining the talents of their favorite local drummer Chase Howard, the group got to work on writing an album that illustrates their current climate.Kadabra from Spokane, Washington U.S., delivers the eerie psyche crawl of acts like Dead Meadow and the heavy fuzzed riff grime of Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats. In the Fall of 2020, they tracked their debut album ""Ultra"" with Dawson Scholz and released it in the Fall of 2021 on Heavy Psych Sounds Records.L﻿inktree2﻿1+R﻿esident4﻿28 S Hewitt StL﻿os Angeles, CA"

Following this inspiration, we will explore who is responding to Lynn Margulis’s work. Anna Tsing is one such person. A﻿nna Tsing proposes we acknowledge fungi and mushrooms as feminist multi-species companions to learn the arts of living on a damaged planet.Our next discussion will read her short Mushrooms as Companion Species, a 2012 paper published before her book The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins (2015).She invites us to question the big stories that maintain the status quo. We are already entangled in fungi’s ways of living, what if we embraced this entangling instead of frivolously trying to detach ourselves, attempting to assert dominance? How do fungi change how think of gender, race, families, governance, and even love? We have since learned there are so many ways to be in relationships with fungi than just foraging – so we will weave together what we've learned where Anna Tsing gave us fertile (full of compost) ground to think from.A﻿bstract: ""Unruly Edges: Mushrooms as Companion Species"" “Human nature is an interspecies relationship. In this essay, Haraway’s concept of companion species takes us beyond familiar companions to the rich ecological diversity without which humans cannot survive. Following fungi, we forage in the last ten thousand years of human disturbance history with feminist multispecies company. Cereals domesticate humans. Plantations give us the subspecies we call race. The home cordons off inter- and intra-species love. But mushroom collecting brings us somewhere else—to the unruly edges and seams of imperial space, where we cannot ignore the interspecies interdependencies that give us life on earth. There are big stories to tell here, and they should not be left to the human triumphalists who control the field. This essay opens a door to multispecies landscapes as protagonists for histories of the world.""B﻿efore the discussion we invite you to:R﻿ead ""Unruly Edges: Mushrooms as Companion Species"" (﻿issues reported with the link above for some folks – so here's a secondary link to the paper above originally posted on the author's blog: https://tsingmushrooms.blogspot.com/)W﻿hat the heck is a Companion Species?Donna *Haraway’s term for the mutually dependent—Haraway’s term is ‘obligatory’—relationship between human animals and certain kinds of non-human animals. Companion species differs from companion animals (such as guide dogs for the blind) in this crucial respect: it implies a two-way dependency. Haraway argues that neither human animals nor non-human animals pre-exist their relationship to one another. This is because the relationship is productive or co-constitutive. Haraway takes this line of thought back to the origin of both humans and dogs and argues that their development has to be seen as an instance of co-evolution. Neither species would be what it is today without the other. Humans are in a state of coexistence with countless microorganisms, Haraway argues, so ‘our’ sense of ‘self’ needs to be rethought (she describes this as a fourth Copernican turn).F﻿or more, check out Haraway's Companion Species Manifesto>﻿>>Join our mycelial network: Sign up for our Substack email newsletter.Follow Exploring the Mycoverse on instagram."

First gaining prominence in the 1920’s, when speakeasies and gambling joints began to appear along its length, the Sunset Strip’s location in the badlands between the cities of Los Angeles (and Hollywood) and Beverly Hills made it perfect for the racy nightclubs that flourished there in the 1930’s, 40’s and 50’s. As the 1960’s dawned it reinvented itself as a rock club scene and epicenter of the new anti-Vietnam war, hippie, counter-culture and then, in the 1970’s, it gained new prominence for its stand-up comedy-clubs that launched the careers of a huge number of famous comedians. Today many of the Sunset Strip’s most legendary venues are still operating and it’s very much a mecca for Angelenos and visitors wanting a fun night out. The Sunset Strip tour is the perfect way to experience this storied neighborhood.We start the Sunset Strip tour at the celebrated Chateau Marmont, before heading west to see the location of one of the first nightclubs to open on the Strip, the Trocadero.

These poems are “throwing a tantrum” about the climate crisis, written by a “child / of imperialism whining about freedom / from the bondage of stuff.” Nancy Lynée Woo transmutes anxiety into dynamic and playful poems, writing into the absurdity of the global crises facing humanity with a soft wit, enduring hope, and deep love for the more-than-human world. Eco-feminism moving at lightspeed, I’d Rather Be Lightning captures a Millennial’s despair over environmental destruction with bolts of humor, compassion, and formal experimentation.A﻿bout the AuthorNancy Lynée Woo is a poet, writer, organizer, and climate activist who harbors a wild love for the natural world.

The focus will be open-ended and will follow whatever direction a spontaneous conversation may lead. It is informal, without expectation, and open to all. The Death Cafe will also bring lightness to the gathering by serving tea and refreshments. Admission is free of charge but there is a suggested donation of $10 towards the nonprofit Philosophical Research Society. About the host:Elizabeth Gill Lui is a fine art photographer, published author, and educator. With a degree in comparative religion from Colorado College, she pursued graduate work in American Indian Studies at the University of Denver, and Transformational Psychology at the University of Philosophical Research. She received certification as a Death Doula in March 2022 from the International Association of Professional Career College.She has been a distinguished visiting artist at schools in the US and Asia, and the recipient of grants from the Ford Foundation, and the Graham Foundation and the Rockefeller Fund. Her books have looked at the cultural significance of architecture and the built environment as humanizing aesthetic forces, while promoting the need for architectural literacy. Her fine art work in photography expands that focus to consider the unity of consciousness and nature, the fractal patterns present in the organic world, and the profound connections that unite us all. Further information can be found at: elizabethlui.comAbout The Death Cafe:The Death Cafe is part of a growing international movement of people who desire to reevaluate and transform our cultural relationship to death. Since September 2011, Death Cafes have spread quickly across Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. As of today, there are 14,409 Death Cafes in 81 countries. It includes many people who are committed to a healthier approach to dying, death and burial, including green burials and alternatives to the problematic practices of the traditional funeral industry. Additional information on Death Cafe's origins and its founder can be found at:  deathcafe.com. Finding Life at The Death Cafe by Elizabeth Gill LuiIf you are reading this, that means that you are not too late to the conversation—the conversation about Death. And it is not too soon to join in. Growing concerns in our culture point to the perpetual state of denial we live in as it relates to Death, and our blinding inability to be moved by its distortion effect on our psyches. Those effects not only dehumanize us, but force death to rear its ugly head in the least desirable of places, remaining unchecked. So pervasive is death, we seek protection by numbing ourselves to its immediacy. From the macro to the micro, it is not surprising that we can hardly attend to our personal experiences of death with any sense of forethought or intimacy.During Covid, Americans exhibited a shocking lack of unanimity finding common cause against a virus that would kill over a million of our fellow citizens, and over 6 million fellow humans worldwide. We also continue to find it difficult to  register that over 150 species go extinct every 24 hours(1). Or, as one author has noted (2), the planet is on life support, and at best is in the last stage of hospice when all  that remains possible is ‘care, not cure.’ We remain numb in making sense of the escalating  violence in our society fueled by guns on a rampage in our schools and supermarkets, or to the fact that the suicide rate in the US is double its homicides.Over the last two years while witnessing amplified issues surrounding mortality, I pursued several things, all of which in one way or another had to do with confronting my life’s finite timeline. As an aging human, I entered my seventh decade. As a philosopher I read and thought, continually questioning why we are the way we are, with an answer eluding me still. As an artist I spent many months working on my archives, placing them in the capable hands of museums and libraries. As a mother and grandmother, I spent precious time with my family. As an environmentalist, I became one of over 40K climate activists in Al Gore’s Climate Reality Leadership Project, and then, with some more time on my hands, and continuing to weigh the inevitable, I became certified as a Death Doula.Many people are familiar with the role of midwives and birth doulas at the bedside of newborns, but I have found not as many know about the practice of Death Doulas in the world of palliative and hospice care for the dying.As expressed poignantly by INELDA, the International End-of-Life Doula Association—It’s time to care for the dying and those close to them with compassionate engagement and open-hearted presence. It’s time to remember and incorporate the traditions of our ancestors, the inner healing and beauty that can be experienced between people surrounding the dying person. It’s time for us to embrace ‘a more enlightened’ approach to care.(3)Like Birth, Death is not a medical event. Dying often is, but Death is not. Both are definitively human and provide the bookends to our lives. As the movement in conscious dying has evolved into what is now termed the Death-Positive movement, many are advocating for supportive ways we can shepherd the dying through the universal experience of what is, one’s final living act. Central to this awareness is that we need more openness in discussing loss, death, and grief, and in that unfolding conversation, our culture might begin to find compassionate ways to approach the inevitability of this life event. For individuals, the hope is to provide a better way of planning for, and accepting, our own deaths. And in helping friends and family navigate the options for end-of-life care, more openness will benefit both the caregivers and the dying.While reading and studying about death and dying I valued discovering concrete resources for things that we all glimpse in our peripheral vision, but avoid attending to: Living Wills, Advance Care Directives, DNR orders, Medical-Assisted-Aid-in-Dying legislation and resources, and newly developed green burial options including Human Composting (NOR) and Aquamation.Pragmatic all, once on this path, you inevitably also come across The Death Cafe (4). The Death Cafe model was developed in Britain by Jon Underwood and Sue Barsky Reid, based on the ideas of French sociologist Bernard Crettaz, with ‘the objective to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives.’ Begun in 2010, Jon launched a project that by 2022 would reach over 140,000 people in over eighty countries. At a Death Cafe people, often strangers, gather to eat cake, drink tea, and discuss death. So simple, yet responding to a deep cultural longing, the level of participation in this transformative communal experiment speaks volumes.As I continued to navigate the subject of death, while trying to live more fully, I approached PRS with the hope of co-hosting a Death Cafe for our community. Our first Cafe was held on 9.15, and will continue monthly, providing safe space for the emotional power of compelling stories, while raising awareness and inspiring action around death, dying, and conscious living.My instinct tells me that if we pay more attention to death, perhaps extend our hands out with the possibility of befriending death, we will embrace it in its life-affirming fullness and natural beauty. At The Death Cafe in September, we found a beginning by personalizing our reasons for attending. I hope you will join us at a future Death Cafe as we further that conversation, and shine light on death, enriching our lives in the process.1 Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird, and mammal become extinct every 24 hours, up to 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.2 William DeBuys.

Dr. Marty Bradley, Sustainable Aviation Consultant and Educator, mkbradle@usc.edu.

He is an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Practice at USC and teaches AIAA short courses in Sustainable Aviation and Electric Aircraft.
Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:
""Model results indicate that solar geoengineering could offset most climate change...“ – Ken Caldeira, Stanford University, National Academies Workshop June 20, 2023
“An operational SRM [Solar Radiation Modification] deployment is the only known approach that could be deliberately implemented to cool the Earth within a few years” - Bala, Caldeira, et al.
