You will also have an opportunity to help with the composting processes. Attending the one-hour orientation is required to gain access to the bin. You will receive a member agreement and then gain the ability start dropping-off your food scraps.About UsWhen Lancaster Compost Co-Ops was started in April 2021, Lancaster residents had zero alternatives to divert organic food and garden scraps from the general waste stream beyond individual backyards. Composting is a mainstream activity in American cities – and we believed it was high time for Lancaster to address the existing community interest.LCC currently has five co-op sites in Lancaster City. Each site has a critter proof and smell proof compost bin in a public space that allows trained community members to create high quality compost. A local community member, or ""captain,"" independently runs the site with the support of the community participants.To learn more, check out our website (www.lancastercompost.us) or Instagram (LancasterCompost).

Patricia has exhibited nationally and internationally, at venues including the Corcoran Museum and two solo shows in Warsaw, Poland in 2007. Her work is included in numerous private collection, and was recently featured at the Hylton Performing Arts Center at George Mason University.  The curator of the George Mason show described Patricia’s work as being “defined by the subtle and sophisticated use of materials and abstract forms to evoke spiritual, linguistic, and natural phenomena. A main theme running through all of Underwood’s bodies of work has been the use of her own unique symbols that she developed early in her career. Starting with Japanese kanji, it built to include unique signs of music and movement, as well as symbols from ancient caves and rock carvings. Throughout her career, Underwood has incorporated and developed these symbols into distinct series of artworks with content and imagery that span ideas related to prehistoric signs of life, lullabies, the female body image and its representation, communication and conflict, and most recently trees and their relationship to humans and climate change.”"

Jocelyn and Megan’s careers in the wine industry converged at a small Italian inspired winery in southwestern Virginia. Their vision in 2021 grew from grapes without a home, a winery with space available, and meraki- a Greek word for doing something with soul, creativity, or love; to leave a piece of yourself in your work. Jocelyn and Megan are part of a new generation of winemakers and wine brands who see an opportunity to continue to transform the typical archetype of a male owned and operated wine business. They are standing on shoulders of women who blazed a trail in the Virginia wine and cider industries and, with the launch of Daring Wine Company, Jocelyn and Megan are continuing to shape their own future in this industry. They started with two single vineyard wines, a Chardonnay and a Barbera, grown from grapes at Stanburn Vineyard Inc., and a dry cider produced from a blend of cider apples grown in central Virginia. Heron Hill WineryHeron Hill has been producing delicious cool-climate wines from the Finger Lakes for nearly 50 years.  They make outstanding riesling, chardonnay, blaufrankish, pinots, and more.  So why include them in a Northern Virginia wine geek Bar Takeover?  We think you know why.  Their winemaker, Jordan Harris, did wonderful things at Tarara Winery in Northern Virginia for nearly a decade, and his winemaking left an impression on the Walsh team.  This is our excuse to get him back in the building.  Join Jordan as he walks us through what he has been working on in the Finger Lakes, contrasting our warm-climate wines with what he is working on up North.  Always a blast and a great source of winemaking knowledge, we are thrillled to have confinced him to join us for his first Bar Takeover$25 / tasting ($20 in advance)Wines will be available for purchase while supplies last."

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

Initially a duo making covers on YouTube during quarantine, Keep Your Secrets evolved into a full band making original music in the summer of 2021, and started building a name for themselves in the DC area alternative music scene. They call their sound ""Cold Brew Core,"" for the monster-drinking warped tour kids who have grown into highly caffeinated adults. Despite their catchy hooks and major-key pop punk sound, Keep Your Secrets’ new EP it's all good explores weighty topics like heartbreak, betrayal, mental illness, structural racism, and climate grief.

Consisting of Estelle Angel (vocals), Thomas Shreve (drums), Tom Fisher (bass), Xela Stockmal and Adam Padilla (guitars), ALR’s scrappy early EPs and dedication to frequent and intense live shows across the East Coast and Midwest earned them attention from national publications including The Alternative and No Echo. Their debut LP “Blooming” in July 2022, the group have developed a sound all their own that often fluctuates violently between the beautiful and the ugly; a theme that remains constant across all aspects of their presentation.Music | Instagram | Facebook | TwitterH﻿ungry BugHungry Bug is a band from the DMV area making their way through the garage punk genre.

We’re all “waiting for the ice to melt,” submitting to the chaos. What’s the use? In a garden of lush experimental rock, Shady Bug invites us to imagine the end of the world as the end of our old selves: a swarm of snakes exiting a red-tinted bar in the Midwest. Shady Bug has shed its lizard skin. Shady Bug has stepped into their most confident era of artful noise and melodic vocal honesty, asserting their trademark harmony of harsh and sweet in 2023 with What’s the Use? on Exploding in Sound Records (NYC).Original members and guitarists Hannah Rainey and Ripple have been cultivating this juxtaposition together since 2017 in St. Louis, MO. Now, coming into her own as a musical leader, the complex compositions on What’s the Use? contain more of Rainey’s voice than any other Shady Bug album. Shady Bug’s current lineup has included bassist Chris Chartrand since 2018, and this is his first time recording with the band. St. Louis drummer Jack Mideke (Smidley, Jr. Clooney) recorded drums on What’s the Use? The four musicians recorded the EP with engineer Alex Molini (Pile, Stove) at the ""Pile HQ"" in Nashville in 2022.With each arrangement grounded by Rainey’s tough yet crystalline vocals, What’s the Use? guides listeners through the clash of exterior and interior worlds — anxiety about climate change, the end of a relationship, and the beginning of self-motivated clarity.https://shadybug.bandcamp.com/album/whats-the-use • Origin Of Speech —electronic dirges and hype darkness project of Bash and Ben based in DC• Homeschool Friend —nu duo made up of aiden from plastic sun and flo petite *all sales are final unless canceled or postponed*"

As the Earls Community grew in size and closeness we came in contact with the reality that many of our supports, volunteers and guest were facing immediate housing and economic crisis. As we noticed a demand from a growing population of homeless citizens our leader Reginald Guy Decided to encourage the earl community to start and operate a non-profit that meets the needs of the people. Thus, The Purpose Party Was Created. In providing free food, water, clothing, and hygiene products for citizens and residents in the communities we are removing socio-physical barriers to civic engagement. In removing the following socio-physical barriers to civic engagement such as: lack of; essential hygienic products, adequate: nutrition, hydration, civic education, shelter, first-aid, and climate protection, we enable citizens and residents to be secure in engaging one another in a equitable and just manner that fosters self-respect, community togetherness, and civic engagement. Once we have addressed and defeated these pressing issues that provide barriers to civic engagement; we then create forums from which we begin to develop the community literacy,  and tackle other root issues that lead to the need for freedom fighters such as ourselves."
