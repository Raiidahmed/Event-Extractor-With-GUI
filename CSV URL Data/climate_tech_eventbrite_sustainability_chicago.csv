Many of the events and organizations we are working with have already cancelled, postponed, or significantly scaled back the physical events they had planned for the first half of 2022, to help mitigate the spread of COVID.Keeping in line with the guidance we are hearing from other professional event planning organizations, we have made the difficult decision to postpone our ""Exploring the Metaverse"" return to physical events. It had originally been planned for March 2, but will be postponed to a later date. We hope to be able to host this event in 2022, and will reserve the topic of the Metaverse for a date when we can return to physical in-person meetings. However, we feel at this time it is best for our audience, presenters, partners and staff to prioritize everybody's health and safety. Details:Is this the Metaverse? Is this just Fantasy?The idea of ‘The Metaverse’ is expansive, still evolving, and not collectively agreed upon yet. It has many of us scratching our heads and coming up with a slew of existential questions. What does this mean, how will it affect me, and what does it mean for our future and children growing up in it?Coinciding with Chicago's Birthday, VRAR Chicago welcomes physical audiences back to our first in-person event since the beginning of the COVID pandemic.Our venue, 1871, is named after the year of Chicago's rebirth after the Great Fire. This great city is once again poised to redefine itself. We now ""return"" to a new normal, following two years of social distancing and immersive technology acceleration. On March 2nd, city and technology leaders will join us to present: The Next Evolution: Exploring The Metaverse.The event will explore the transformational combination of virtual and augmented reality with mobile and internet technology, as they all combine to evolve the way we work, play, and live here in Chicago and beyond.Covid Policy for Physical EventsVRAR Chicago is committed to keeping our Chicago community safe.Proof of Vaccination RequirementAll guests will be required to show state-issued ID along with proof of vaccinations of the final shot of immunization regime over two weeks prior to event via card or photo of proof.Face Coverings RequiredIn all common areas when not actively eating or drinking. What's The Format:The primary event will be held at 1871: 222 W Merchandise Mart Plaza.More details TBA: https://www.vrarchicago.com/metaverseAttending Virtually: We will be using Virbela's Open Campus to host the virtual aspects of the program. We suggest that you download, set-up, get familiar with the Virbela program (virbela.com/download) and environment prior to the program, as we will be unable to provide support during the event. The event will also streamed on Facebook.com/VRARChicago  (facebook.com/VRARChicago/live_videos/).The virtual environment resembles a physical space, so you will be able to talk with other attendees during open networking both before and after the presentations. The sound is spatialized, so if at any point it feels too loud, feel free to move your conversation to another part of the room where there are less people. We begin with informal networking and then start the stage portion promptly at 6:15pm CDT. There will be a handful of presentations before we move on to answer audience questions and then finish with more networking. We keep it simple and informal - this MeetUp is about you, our members, and not the host or presenters.

You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals. ANYONE CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER, BUT BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE JOURNALING PRACTICE THAT'S FUN REQUIRES CONSISTENCY. Are you ready to explore what journaling that celebrates yourself could look and feel like for you? Sign up today, check your email for details, and arrive ready to go all in!

DOT regulations state: “Any person involved in offering a hazardous material for transportation must be properly trained” Upon completion, you will be able to:Demonstrate the correct methods used for the shipping, handling, and transporting of hazardous materialsIdentify the proper shipping methods for hazardous materials in air, water, and land.Recognize information needed on shipping papers for specific types of hazardous wastesUtilize proper labeling, marking, and placarding required for hazardous waste transportationDevelop information gathering techniques needed for required incident reporting and emergency notificationShow an understanding of the documentation for shipping papers and manifests.After your initial training, you will need to refresh your certification every 3 years or when the regulations ""substantially change"". This course qualifies as the “initial” training or “refresher” training. Be advised that should your certification lapse, you may not take part in any hazardous materials shipping functions “unsupervised” until your certification has been renewed.Our DOT Hazmat Course uses a unique ""10-step approach"" for shipping and handling hazardous materials properly. Each element is covered in detail through the use of ""real-world"" examples of what “to do” and “what NOT to do” when shipping hazardous materials.Industries using DOT Transportation certification include but are not limited to:Trucking CompaniesCDL DriversPackage Delivery CompaniesMedical Supply Delivery CompaniesHome Medical Supply CompaniesChemical Manufacturing or ShippingEnvironmental firms that package and ship hazardous wasteTreatment, Storage, and Disposal FacilitiesWarehouse PersonnelPlease be advised: Extensive Student participation and interaction during this class is REQUIRED.

Virtually all of us have fallen prey to its deceptive, divisive effects in some aspect of our lives and have felt its consequences in our relationships and other issues that affect our shared quality of life. So how can we protect ourselves, our communities, and our causes from the insidious effects of hate and deception? In this funny, practical talk, longtime civil rights activist and communications strategist Sabrina Joy Stevens exposes the age-old political manipulation tactics at the root of what social scientists now call information disorder. Relying on both personal experience and robust research, she breaks down how bad actors mislead the rest of us into hate and self-sabotage for their own political and economic gain. She also reveals how love, humility, and courage can help us outsmart this kind of manipulation. While the scale of this problem has certainly increased with the advent of new technologies, information disorder is actually a very old, very familiar problem. With the right mindsets and habits, we can come together to make mass deception a thing of the past instead of letting it define our future. Panel Introduction - Jocelyn Leitzinger, University of Illinois Chicago 9:35-9:45 am     Panel: The Disinformation of the Future  (9:45-10:30 am) Sabrina Joy StevensAshley AndersonJocelyn LeitzingerJennifer Choi - ModeratorBreak (10:30 -10:45 am)Workshop - Pipelines of Information - Jocelyn Leitzinger (10:45 -11:40 am)   Conclusion/Call to Action + Networking with appetizers and light refreshments (11:45 am -12:15 pm)             Exit (12:30 pm)                ResourcesClimate Change Disinformation work Merchants of Doubt Official Trailer 1 (2014) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ii9zGFDtc&t=8s  Play the Fake News Game → https://www.getbadnews.com/books/english/  Can You Spot the Troll?  https://spotthetroll.org/Angry Uncle Bot https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/18/opinion/thanksgiving-family-argue-chat-bot.htmlE﻿vent Details:Friday, July 21st, 2023, 8:30 am - 12:30 pm CT, in person at The University of Illinois at Chicago campus and live streaming TBA!In-person address: The University of Illinois Chicago-Student Center East; Room 605 - 750 South Halsted St. Chicago IL 60607Parking: For all events taking place in Student Center East‚ parking is available in the Halsted and Taylor Street Parking Structure (760 West Taylor Street).
