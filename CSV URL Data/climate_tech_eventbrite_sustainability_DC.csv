A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

The philanthropic and business communities are targeting resources in the name of creating equity and improving outcomes for all groups. From corporations and nonprofits to universities and government agencies, many entities have constructed outward-facing equity statements and have directed management to lead the charge of achieving equity. However, frustration remains for those who are on the front lines working to disrupt and dismantle inequities within public health, education, housing, and workforce systems. To this end, Iona Concepts, Inc. has created a menu of Transformational Learning Circles. These sessions are designed to incorporate the voices of those who are at the forefront of this work and responsible for creating and implementing practices that move the needle of change toward progress. These collaborative convenings are iterative and build on the collective experiences of our Brain Trust, a cadre of seasoned practitioners who center liberatory practices and have a track record of executing models that are disrupting structural inequities and violence in organizational systems and communities. Transformational Learning Circles are curated for participants who aim to learn about and achieve sustainable and transferable practices that advance racial justice and healing inside and outside organizational systems and communities. Sessions are held at Baltimore Unity Hall 1505 Eutaw Place, Baltimore, MD 21217 at no cost, yet monetary donations are welcomed. We encourage Baltimore City’s social and public health organizations, social entrepreneurs,  educators, students, and researchers to join us. At the completion of each circle, p﻿articipants will receive a certificate of completion. For registration, we require the completion of this surveyT﻿o get in contact with our team, please reach us at: admin@livewellbemore.comTransformational Learning CirclesConducting Race Equity Audits and BenchmarksThursday, 5/22/23, 1 - 4 pm (date change from original 5/18/22)Funders are tying strings to connect resources by requesting that providers create equity strategies and benchmarks. This process begins with auditing policies, practices, and operational systems. Collecting information for analysis requires a multi-prong approach of reviewing pre-existing data, including the origin story of the institution, human resources data, and conducting key informant surveys and interviews.  This session will explore how this process can create organizational “white water” by triggering racial trauma for people of color and uncovering unconscious biases of supervisors and co-workers. Participants will learn:- Key indicators to facilitate an analysis that focuses on measuring the impact of REDI audits and benchmarking - Learn key strategies to navigate the turbulence of uncovering disparities that are often baked into organizational cultureWhen Race, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (REDI) Create PTSDThursday, 6/15/23, 1- 4 pmPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hidden condition that can be triggered by ongoing experiences with microaggression, discrimination, and retaliation for speaking up and out about inequitable policies, practices, and culture that undermines people who experience discrimination due to class, disability, educational/employment status, ethnicity, gender expression or identity, national origin, race and sexual orientation individually or with intersectionality. This condition can also be triggered when frontline REDI practitioners constantly experience covert, uninformed, and performative efforts without a real destination or plan of action.  This session will explore how Courageous Conversations designed to uncover workplace biases are often fatiguing and can trigger workplace PTSD. Participants will learn how to recognize the conditions of a toxic work environment and learn strategies to support and implement mindfulness within organizational operating norms.Healing the DEI OfficersThursday, 7/20/23, 1-4 pmFacilitating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should/must confront the history and apparatus of racism. DEI practitioners’ bodies become the container for the resistance of shifting power dynamics.  The DEI arena consists of practitioners who were promoted to often ambiguous positions without the benefit of committed leadership and the authority to move the needle of racial equity in policy and practice. This session will explore the restraining forces that take a toll on the economic, emotional, mental well-being of practitioners, and ultimately resulting in physical health challenges and a diminished quality of work life.  Participants will share strategies to cope in toxic environments and will learn ways to leverage healing technologies in the moment to develop a practice of self-care in the workplace.Interior Design Principles for Trauma-Exposed PublicsThursday, 8/17/23, 1-4 pmThe work environment can promote productivity and a healing space for those who work in trauma-exposed environments. Often, social health practitioners are exposed to vicarious trauma as a result of working with community members who are experiencing chronic and compound stress. The interior composition of a client serving environment can further induce toxic stress. This session will explore how the positioning of furniture in the workplace, color pallets, art, lighting, plants, sound and ergonomics can reduce stress for both provider and client. Participants will learn trauma informed design principles that promote wellness and biophilia in the workplace.Collaboration over CompetitionThursday, 9/21/23, 1-4 pmCapitalism is baked into institutions’ operating norms.  Disrupting Eurocentric ethos of rugged individualism, scarcity and competitiveness in the Black social uplift space is important to our collective movement and sustainability. Dismantling social determinants of health will require the disruption of silos that further reinforce competition over collective impact and outcomes.   To embrace the principles of Ubuntu (I am because we are) is to begin to unlearn the principles of bootstrapping.  Participants will learn how to incorporate the principles of Ubuntu, create and deepen partnerships and collaborations, and identify tools to interact with those who have not embraced the principles of Ubuntu.Dismantling the Myth of White Supremacy at WorkThursday, 10/19/23, 1-4 pmThe Myth of White Supremacy is centered in every aspect of workplace culture, interpersonally and structurally. It is not just the water in which we all exist; it is an anti-oppressive decision point that one ultimately decides to make or not to make. Dismantling the myth of white supremacy in work environments requires individuals, communities, and organizations to understand the stakes and range of possibilities of either choice. This session will explore the tactics used to promote the myth of white supremacy culture, including supervisory styles, communication practices, competitive environments, and performance reviews.  Participants will engage in experiential processes that uncover the operating norms, as well as, uncover strategies to dismantle operational practices, policies, and procedures that reinforce and burden internal and external stakeholders. Facilitating Data-Driven REDIThursday, 11/16/23, 1-3 pm With a standard in place that defines and identifies what it means to be diverse, equitable and inclusive it becomes possible to measure diversity, equity and inclusion in a company, understand that company’s “level” of diversity, equity and inclusion against the standard and drive measurable and methodical results - i.e. make the company more diverse, equitable and inclusive over time. This requires data skills on the part of the facilitator and leaders in the company. This session will introduce participants to a new measurement system and tool for diversity, equity and inclusion, and methods for understanding decision funnels in companies that can be analyzed and utilized to drive improvements.These sessions are in part sponsored by Innovation Works."

We want this to be an event that strives to recreate the unique experience found at TED, where the world’s leading thinkers and doers congregate to share what they are most passionate about. At its core, the fundamental goal of TED and TEDxUStreetWomen is to foster and spread great ideas while celebrating Washington DC and the U Street Corridor community. 														  			Bold + Brilliant = Badass is our Mantra! What do we mean when we say, Bold + Brilliant =  Badass?  To be Bold, means you are willing to speak out for the issues that mean the most to you.  To be Brilliant, means you have the experience, knowledge, and passion needed to advocate for your idea. When you combine Bold + Brilliant, the results is a Badass. Being a Badass means that, despite your fear, any potential backlash/criticism, or how unpopular your idea maybe to some, you will still push forward to share your truth.   														  BE BOLD.   BE BRILLIANT.   BE BADASS.
  BE BETTER 
 We've all heard the saying - do better.  We've even challenged ourselves to do better.  This year's theme takes doing better to another level.  You will hear speakers share their ideas on how doing is not enough, we as humans need to BE Better.  To be better means to do things at a higher degree often and consistently to create sustainability. Join us as we look at ways to Be Better humans. Are you ready to be a part of a network and connect with individuals who are Bold, Brilliant and Badass?Why TEDxUStreetWomenWomen are realizing that the way things used to be is not the way things should be. More and more, women are becoming empowered to break the glass ceilings and strive towards finding their place in leadership roles. Roles that challenges the old way of thinking while creating opportunities for women to make a difference in the world. Women are not new to leadership; think of Cleopatra or Queen Elizabeth. Think of the women who led the civil rights and education reform movements. However, women are still outnumbered by men in the most prestigious positions, from Capitol Hill to the board room.Although a lot is being done to change the way women are seen, much still needs to be done. Women make up more than half the U.S. population, yet there are only one in five women in Congress. Men still out pace women in salaries and positions. Women across the globe are regaining their confidence and becoming bold, brilliant and unapologetic. During this conference, we will celebrate, not only the successes of women, but ponder on ways to be innovative and inspirational. Ways to affect the planet and the people on it.We want to change the social norms and empower women to be Bold and Brilliant.  We don't want women to be ashamed of speaking their truths.  This platform is for Badass women who want to share their idea that can change the world!Why U Street Corridor?As a 6th generation Washingtonian, I’ve always known U Street to be a community build on activism. Arthur Ashe once said, “The corner of 14th and U was the grapevine. . . . If you were at that corner, you always had the sense that something big was about to happen”.  Known as Washington’s cultural center at the turn of the century, U Street has long been a backbone of the city’s homegrown jazz, arts, and civil rights movements. Once bearing the scars of riots and protests, today it has regained its rightful place as the street to showcase DC’s vibrant cultural life, from music and food to activism and art. U Street has historically brought Washingtonians together to the sound of its homegrown music, from jazz and blues to rock and go-go. Today its renovated clubs, new restaurants and shops are once again the center of DC’s humming nightlife. U Street is home for those who want to march to their own beat.  It’s both historic and colorful, boasting some of the richest culture of the city and full of bars, restaurants, and boutiques – as well as plenty of DC locals who come to enjoy the culture and the people-watching.

Aaron's passion and love of hockey came to what he thought would be an abrupt halt in 2005, but his determination continued, ultimately leading him to a 5-year career playing professional hockey. His journeys and successes wouldn't have been possible without the extremely powerful visualization practice he developed. Aaron has a truly inspiring story of overcoming a tremendous amount of adversity. His hockey career, post-secondary studies, and personal experiences led Aaron to develop his unique practice. Today, he is dedicated to teaching others how to find their true grit through visualization. S﻿pecial thanks to our PWBC Phoenix Diamond PartnersM﻿edstar Health & D.C.
