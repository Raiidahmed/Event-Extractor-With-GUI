In conversation with Christina Brophy.P﻿LEASE NOTE: This free event is first come, first served; RSVPs are encouraged. Seating is limited. Doors open at 5:30 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.Fueled by an abiding concern with environmental crisis for more than three decades, contemporary artist Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) depicts an ominous and complex vision of ocean life affected by humankind in a monumental new series titled Oceanus. Alexis Rockman: Oceanus takes the viewer on a global journey of discovery beneath the world's changing seas, through the artist's ethereal and sublime renderings of real and imaginary marine life within a fragile ecosystem. Published to accompany an ambitious traveling exhibition in North America and abroad, this volume documents Rockman's newly executed 8 x 24-foot panoramic painting Oceanus and ten related large watercolors, important works that tell the story of humanity's indelible relationship with the ocean and the connections between the sea and our own survival, as the artist deftly weaves natural history, art history, archaeology, adventure, political analysis, and science into a story about the human condition. Complementing this stunning presentation of Rockman's paintings--as well as many details and photographs documenting the artist's process, along with a rich selection of contextual imagery--are essays by leading writers and scholars on such topics as maritime and oceanic history and Rockman's work within the larger context of art history.
Alexis Rockman is a contemporary American painter known for his fantastical paintings of dystopian natural environments. Rockman tackles ecological issues—such as climate change and species extinction—through his large-scale artworks. Part-artist, part-activist, he confronts pressing social issues head on through carefully rendered paintings of animals and their rapidly changing environments.Christina Brophy is Senior Director of Museum Galleries and Senior Vice President of Curatorial Affairs at the Mystic Seaport Museum."

Guided by experts from the North Brooklyn Community Boathouse, we will depart in two gorgeous 29’  canoes to explore Newtown Creek and experience our multiple kelp restoration sites. No paddling experience necessary! We will go under bridges, pass along bulkheads, rip rap, barges. Along the way, we will see shorebirds, wild oysters and ribbed mussels. We will chat a little about seaweed restoration, remediation, and water quality. But mostly, we want you to feel how nice it is to be on the water. How amazing it would be if it were clean and we, the public, had access to be on it.  There will be a short ladder to climb down to the canoes. Life jackets will be provided and must be worn by all paddlers. Wear comfortable, old clothes and shoes/sneakers. No flip-flops. Bring a windbreaker or fleece, depending on the weather. Wear sunscreen. Sunglasses/sun hats are recommended. All attendees must fill out a waiver.Seaweed City is a collaborative project led by Shanjana Mahmud and Luke Eddins. We would like to sincerely thank Anonymous Was A Woman Environmental Arts Grant and NYFA for their support of our kelp activities this year and specifically these tours.

Flushing Creek was artificially forced underground at sections into pipes for the construction of the 1939 World’s Fair grounds and now runs beneath and through the center of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Daylighting, or restoring underground portions of a waterway into above ground habitats, has immense benefits for social-ecological health and climate resilience.Organized by Guardians of Flushing Bay together with artist and educator Julia Norton, each of the four workshops in this series will be led by a different Queens-based artist selected through an open call. Some workshops will move through the park to examine Flushing Creek first hand, while others will remain in the museum to consider the waterway more broadly. The workshops will allow for exploration within a variety of artistic mediums, such as conceptual practice and hands-on art making. The goal of the workshops is to reveal Flushing Creek through visual materials and content that can be utilized in engaging local park users in the future possibility of daylighting Flushing Creek. These workshops will be designed for adults ages 18 and older. Any minors older than 12 are welcome to participate, but must be accompanied by an adult. All participants should be prepared for uneven terrain, long outdoor walks and muddy conditions. No prior experience is necessary."

Come chill in the Catacombs with us, as this flaxen-haired fiddler extraordinaire shows us a world at risk, and reminds us why we need to protect Earth's most precious natural resources before they vanish for good.For more information on this evening’s program and the performers, visit Death of Classical’s website.

Globally, there are around 100 million people without homes and 1.6 billion people living in unsuitable housing conditions. And these numbers are continually rising. The pandemic, migration, and the climate crisis have and will continue to have a negative influence on the rising number of the unhoused. In addition to economic and social measures, a notably significant factor is the environment in which the socially marginalized live. An important component of any interdisciplinary team, therefore, must include architects.What is the situation in the Czech Republic and in European cities? And what role do architects have in improving the situation? What innovative approaches can be used to integrate people with experience of homelessness back into society? The lecture will include a screening of three short films about selected projects from the Architecture of Coexistence series (by Architects without Borders, Czechia and artyčok.TV): Bedřiška, Ostrava (Czechia), VinziRast-mittendrin, Vienna (Austria), Bellevue di Monaco, Munich (Germany).Ing. arch. Karolína Kripnerová, Ph.D.

is an architect interested in the social overlaps of architecture. She lectures, writes articles and moderates discussions on topics such as public space, homelessness and affordable housing. She is co-founder of the nonprofit Architects without Borders, Czechia. She teaches at the Faculty of Architecture at the Czech Technical University in Prague and works in the Kazimour Kripnerová architekti studio. Thanks to a Fulbright scholarship, she continues her research in New York in cooperation with the nonprofit Community Solutions."

Lalela uLwandle means “Listen to the Sea” in isiZulu. At some point in our lives, many of us have picked up a large shell and placed it against our ears to hear the sound of the oceans within it. It is this image that we invoke in this project, of standing quietly on the beach and listening to the stories of the ocean, and the people who have an intimate relationship with it. Weaving the stories, histories and contemporary concerns of diverse South African coastal communities into an Empatheatre production, Lalela uLwandle explores themes of intergenerational environmental injustices, tangible and intangible ocean heritage, marine science and the myriad threats to ocean health.The performance sheds new light and hope on some of the well-known conundrums of ocean governance. Most noticeably it has surfaced intangible heritages of the ocean, and challenged evidence hierarchies in local law and international policy. Recently the audio play of Lalela uLwandle was used as evidence (along with two other short films from Empatheatre) in three court proceedings in legal cases against Oil and Gas giant Shell and the South African government in 2022. The play, was used as evidence to support the rich and powerful affidavits of small scale fishers and other ocean defenders in the case. This was the first time in SA history, that art was used as evidence in ocean governance, and found ways to represent indigenous intangible heritage in meaningful and inclusive ways. One of the most significant aspects of the play illustrates how natural and social scientists can collaborate with holders of different knowledge systems, respectfully and constructively, to develop a more integrated understanding of environmental challenges. The play also illuminates the close connections between human rights and ocean-climate governance, from the local to the international level. There will be a discussion with the audience after the performance, in which we look forward to engaging with different policy makers and publics, experts and stakeholders. During these discussions, we think critically about the importance of listening to and mutual learning among researchers, spiritual healers, small-scale fishers and other stakeholders, and how this can transform the way we understand unexplored connections to the ocean and its role in climate governance.  Lalela uLwandle is an invitation to a participatory public conversation on ocean governance in South Africa. It is funded under the One Ocean Hub, a five-country hub of researchers exploring more democratic methods of engagement in ocean governance.

As ESG issues become increasingly pertinent to both the developed and the emerging world, there is a greater need to quantity risk(s) emanating from company operations and developing tools to measure and manage ESG risks. Since the materiality of ESG issues differs by industry, a common quantification system to compare entity performance on ESG parameters is the need of the hour. This is important to have cross-entity evaluation as well. Quantifying ESG risk involves understanding relevant ESG factors for an entity, understanding each factor’s importance for the entity, assigning weights based on the importance, and then scoring an entity’s initiatives and measures to mitigate the ESG risk. The approach to quantify ESG risk works like a common currency to compare entities on a uniform scale and provide a quick idea about their management of ESG issues.

On June 14th 2022 we will reunite the North American investment research industry at the Metropolitan Club, New York - panels will cover how the end of the SEC no action relief will now play out, where corporate access has levelled out post-lockdowns, how a volatile market climate is affecting the external research and data that asset managers need to consume, and how budgeting and valuation has evolved as a result.

Though it is often framed in abstract terms—warming scenarios, emissions pathways, integrated assessment models for damages, and fuel mixes in the grid—it is rarely experienced this way. Rather, the global energy transition and the broader struggle for climate justice are often understood—and thus won or lost—in materialist terms: through investments in the buildings, landscapes, public works, and built environment that stitch together everyday life for most people. This is the proposition at the core of Green New Dealers’ program—to transform how and where we live and relate to one other by tackling carbon emissions and inequality at once. But these forces extend well beyond the boundaries of a parcel of building envelope where designers typically engage with questions of climate action. The technologies at the core of the energy transition—solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, battery farms, data centers, and advanced nuclear power—all depend on a planetary supply matrix of rare earth elements and critical minerals. These pockets of exceedingly valuable ore tend to be developed in the Global South—and especially in the most remote locations of the Global South, where rules, laws, and norms can be suspended or ignored by multinational mining companies without the scrutiny of local or international press. The poles of this process—the mines and the end-use technological deployments—are linked through a network of waste disposal sites, manufacturing hubs, renewable energy deployment zones, and the various labor and logistical forces that make them all possible.  One of those poles rests in South Greenland’s Kvanefjeld Mine—an erstwhile uranium mine that was key to the Allies’ postwar nuclear energy and weapons programs, that was subsequently decommissioned after decades of anti-mining militancy by a local group of Inuit activists known as Urani? Naamik! (Uranium? No thanks!). But prospectors have since discovered that the mine is home to the world’s second-densest deposit of rare earth elements and critical minerals that, coupled with Greenland’s postcolonial relationship with Denmark, and the region has entered a state of suspended reality as interested parties wait for the Danish court system to rule on exploitation licenses for the site. This lecture will situate Greenland within the global energy transition and implicate its future in that of the Global North. Put another way, this lecture will ask what it means for resource communities like Narsaq, Greenland for the U.S. and other imperial powers to pursue the kind of resource-intensive energy transition that is now underway. “Fire, Ice, and Ore” is presented as part of e-flux Architecture Lectures, a monthly series inviting researchers and practitioners to discuss timely issues in contemporary architecture, theory, culture, and technology.Billy Fleming is the founding Wilks Family Director of the Ian L. McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design. He is a co-founder of the Climate + Community Project—a climate justice think tank dedicated to connecting movement demands and progressive legislators through applied research—and co-creator of the organization Data Refuge—an international initiative to secure critical environmental data at risk of erasure during the Trump Administration. His work includes the recent books A Blueprint for Coastal Adaptation with Carolyn Kousky and Alan Berger, and Design With Nature Now with Frederick Steiner, Richard Weller, and Karen M’Closkey. Billy’s writing and scholarship have appeared in Dissent, The Guardian, Washington Post, New York Times, Places Journal, and Journal of Architectural Education, among others. His current book project is titled Building Just, Post-Carbon Futures: Imagining and Implementing Climate Justice in America and is expected in 2024.For more information, contact program@e-flux.com.Accessibility					 –Two flights of stairs lead up to the building’s front entrance at 172 Classon Avenue.		  –For elevator access, please RSVP to program@e-flux.com.

In a theater in New York City, seven teens gather to put on a play because our world is burning and they have something to say about it. In this visceral and confronting new play, a cast of teenagers grapple with the realities of the world they are inheriting, hold the audience to account, and imagine new pathways forward together. Directed by Nick J. Browne with original music by Curtis Gillen, Is My Microphone On? is inspired by Greta Thurnberg and the tenacity of youth across the globe who are taking a stand for themselves and future generations. With music, confronting dialogue, and poetic language this play is a platform for the youth of New York to lift their voices, inspire dialogue regarding the climate crisis, and investigate how to heal a burning world if those in positions of power refuse to wake up and enact meaningful change now. This is the alarm.

Rae Kelliher is a veteran environmental activist and pioneer in the death-with-dignity movement. Facing a diagnosis of terminal illness, she engages in a shocking suicide murder, taking the life of an oil company CEO for his role in delaying responses to climate disruption. Seven years later, Rae’s friends and family gather at her Vermont farm community to try to understand her violent exit and the rapid social transformations around them.I Want a Better CatastropheWith global warming projected to rocket past the 1.5°C limit, lifelong activist Andrew Boyd is thrown into a crisis of hope, and off on a quest to learn how to live with the “impossible news” of our climate doom. He searches out eight leading climate thinkers — from collapse-psychologist Jamey Hecht to grassroots strategist adrienne maree brown, eco-philosopher Joanna Macy, and Indigenous botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer — asking them: “Is it really the end of the world? and if so, now what?”About the Festival:Named after the sixth mass extinction event currently underway, the Sixth Fest has put on more than 40 events and productions in New York, Chicago, and online. From poetry to panels, pageants to protests, we are a fringe festival both in that we encourage people to create their own events, and that those events can be of whatever kind.

Trapped together in dystopia, they explore the meaning of their lives together through imagination, play, and reminiscences of the past. It is a play about human resilience, love and hate, isolation and friendship, environmental collapse, and of course, recycling.Debating Extinctiona new play by Padraig Bonddirected by Padraig Bondstarring Penelope Deen, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor LazarDebating Extinction is a bold romance about the modern question of whether or not to have children in the face of the climate crisis. Susan and Teddy are young lovers living post climate change, and are preparing to have a child to restart humanity, but they must keep it secret from Susan’s tyrannical, yet deeply environmentalist mother.

Curated by Amanda + James in partnership with Asia Stewart, The third iteration of Summer happenings is centered on the theme of coastlines.Too often, many of us rush through New York City and forget that we live on a series of islands whose natural landscape has been adapted and shaped by generations of forgotten inhabitants.  We neglect our land’s past: the violence that resides in soil stolen from the Lenape people (including the Wappinger, Munsee Lenape, Schaghticoke, Canarsie, Matinecock, and Lekawe nations). We look past the waterways’ paths; many brush up against terminals, docks, and piers and have been constructed for and destroyed by cycles of trade, capital, and exchange. As coastal living becomes increasingly precarious with climate change, we hope you will consider the history, value, beauty, and fragility of our brackish borders. Our presence here is not neutral."

Learn about summer volunteer and internship opportunitiesBuild community with other students Talk to professionals about green careers Explore possible career pathways This expo was created by the 2022-23 Youth Leadership Council, in collaboration with Office of Sustainability What is a Climate Career? Our goal is clear: together, we need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and stop burning fossil fuels. And we need to do this in a way that is equitable and just. Any one of the thousands of jobs that help with that is a climate career! You could focus on reducing GHG emissions in buildings - working in designing, construction, or clean energy. Or you could manage green space, by working in natural areas or agriculture. You might help us move toward “circularity” - reducing waste through repairing goods or reusing materials. Or you may help your community be more resilient. This means reducing peoples’ vulnerability to climate hazards.  Maybe you want to be an educator and teach people about climate change, or you love economics and want to help finance solutions. Maybe you’ll invent a solution no one knows about yet!  Whatever your interests, there is a climate career path for you. Participating Organizations We'll have representatives from over 20 different organizations, all focused on environment, climate, or green industries. Come learn about the different opportunities available in the NYC area and speak to workers who are taking climate action in their jobs!Student-Led WorkshopsW﻿e have optional, student-led workshops:Climate Communications in Your School Upcycling Workshop W﻿e'll also have a keynote speaker to talk about being a young climate professional, and activities like an eco-book swap!

Join the Office of Sustainability on Chancellor’s Day for climate education professional learning. Earn up to 5 CTLE credits!This content is created and led by the DOE's Climate Education Leadership Team (CELT). CELT is a group of over 30 NYC Public Schools teachers and administrators. Their goal is to integrate full and equitable climate education across all areas of study and school culture.We have four workshops, facilitated by CELT Members, that can be applied in all grade levels and subjects:Workshop 1:  Planning and Implementing a Climate Action Day A Climate Teach-In is a great way to catalyze school-wide education and awareness about climate change. This session will provide ideas, guidance and year-long support for educators looking to facilitate school-wide events, and lay the foundation for a Climate Action Day, as called for PlaNYC(New York City's climate action strategic plan).Workshop 2: Accessing & Sharing Climate Resources Learn about CELT's monthly Climate Ed Digest which is packed full of resources to teach about climate education. We will show you how to access the documents and work on a fun hands-on project that can be modified for any grade. The session will also provide strategies to share climate communication with your colleagues.  Workshop 3:  Climate Education Advocacy 101 Develop your advocacy skills by refining a “pitch” to use at your own school to advance climate education. Learn the four key “asks” that the Advocacy subcommittee of CELT has identified, and the climate education goals in the Mayor’s recent PlaNYC. We will practice using advocacy skills in activities with your students and Green Teams turning our goals into actions! Workshop 4:  Easy Entryways for Climate Education: Scaffolding Data and Texts in the ClassroomTeachers are under pressure to teach a certain curriculum and prepare for certain exams. This limits curricular flexibility and time. We'll provide accessible entryways to teach climate education using data and texts. Strategies and resources available for grade levels K-12.

This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.
