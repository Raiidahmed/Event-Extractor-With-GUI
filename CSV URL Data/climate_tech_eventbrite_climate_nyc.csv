I can’t stop thinking about this visionary novel and its singular characters. Nick Fuller Googins has written a book for the present and the future — read this and you will be changed.” — Michelle Min Sterling, New York Times bestselling author of Camp Zero“A magnificent debut novel that’s both an important cautionary tale and a deeply compelling family story. Although set in a stunningly well-imagined future in the aftermath of a climate apocalypse, The Great Transition is electrifyingly relevant.” — William Kent Krueger, New York Times bestselling author of This Tender Land“[The Great Transition] melds the huge and the intimate, the imperatives of our global climate crisis with the more compact narrative of a family trying to do right by one another when the world goes sideways. Fuller-Googins stares down some of today's biggest societal issues with abundant imagination and endless empathy.” — Emily Nemens, author of The Cactus League“Nick Fuller Googins demonstrates exactly the kind of clear-eyed utopian thinking we’ll need more of as we work together to solve our climate crisis, wrapping a call to action, accountability, and mutual aid in a story that’s as thrilling as it is moving. Every worthwhile novel sets out to change its reader—this one sets out to change the world. I hope it does.” — Matt Bell, author of Appleseed“The Great Transition asks what it means to start over — as a society and as individuals — and then answers with visionary scope. Offering readers thrilling glimpses into utopic possibilities born from collective mobilization, as well as an unflinching assessment of our climate crisis, Nick Fuller Googins brilliantly renders the personal political and the political personal.” — Allegra Hyde, author of EleutheriaRESERVE YOUR SIGNED COPY OF THE GREAT TRANSITIONAVAILABLE TO SHIP MOST PLACESEmi Vargas, whose parents helped save the world, is tired of being told how lucky she is to have been born after the climate crisis. But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is a breathtaking rendering of our near future, told through the story of one family trying to protect each other and the place we all call home.This is a free in-store event with limited amphitheater-style seatingWe encourage all guests to wear masks.The talk will be followed by a book signing. Books signed at P&T Knitwear events must be purchased from P&T Knitwear. If you would like a signed copy and cannot attend the event, we're happy to take your pre-order.

It is a kind of absolute present, real life captured in closeup.“  —Annie Ernaux, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature About The Light Room:From “one of our most formally ambitious writers” (Esquire), a moving account of caretaking in a time of uncertainty and lossIn The Light Room, Zambreno offers her most profound and affecting work yet: a candid chronicle of life as a mother of two young daughters in a moment of profound uncertainty about public health, climate change, and the future we can expect for our children. Moving through the seasons, returning often to parks and green spaces, Zambreno captures the isolation and exhaustion of being home with a baby and a small child, but also small and transcendent moments of beauty and joy. Inspired by writers and artists ranging from Natalia Ginzburg to Joseph Cornell, Yūko Tsushima to Bernadette Mayer, Etel Adnan to David Wojnarowicz, The Light Room represents an impassioned appreciation of community and the commons, and an ecstatic engagement with the living world.How will our memories, and our children’s, be affected by this time of profound disconnection? What does it mean to bring new life, and new work, into this moment of precarity and crisis? In The Light Room, Kate Zambreno offers a vision of how to live in ways that move away from disenchantment, and toward light and possibility.About the author:Kate Zambreno is the author of many acclaimed books including Drifts, To Write As If Already Dead, and Heroines. Her writing has appeared in The New Yorker, Granta, The Paris Review, The White Review, and elsewhere. The recipient of a 2021 Guggenheim Fellowship in nonfiction, she teaches in the graduate nonfiction program at Columbia University and is the Strachan Donnelley Chair in Environmental Writing at Sarah Lawrence College."

Jewelry is our lens, with a twin focus on artistry and responsible practice. A focus, we suggest, unique to IAC.All of us, from those upstream in supply chains to those realizing an artistic vision in fine jewelry, must maintain purpose: we must do the work, ever-committed to effecting the change we seek.Thus, conscious of the imperative to balance the needs of current and future generations, we explore varied declarations of purpose and principle on responsible practice and cultural preservation and how to harmonize and operationalize them, taking action, driven by aspiration. We consider new technologies for extraction and sourcing, new mine-to-market models, and new approaches to training, whether the next generation of jewelers or miners. Always with an eye to meeting evolving environmental and climate challenges.Perhaps most fundamentally, we investigate the critical question of what constitutes luxury in an age of responsible practice.During the conference, IAC will present its 6th annual award for Leadership in Responsible Practice and 3rd annual award for Extraordinary Contributions to the Diamond and Jewelry Industries.The conference kicks off with a welcoming reception at Heritage Auctions New York located at 445 Park Avenue with remarks by Roberta Kramer, Vice President, Strategy & Business Development at Heritage.

It's the story of one enormous tuna and the dedicated fisherman who first tagged her. Dubbed Amelia (for her transatlantic journey), this fish was first caught off the New England coast by an enigmatic man named Al Anderson. Though a lifelong professional fisherman, Anderson did not see fish simply as a means to a paycheck. Rather, he understood that his own livelihood depended on that of the fish he caught. In riveting detail, Pinchin follows the story of how Al's obsession - he tagged over 60,000 fish in his lifetime -  made him just as many enemies as it did friends, as he existed in the unique and often tense space between a booming bluefin tuna industry and science-fueled conservation efforts. Kings of Their Own Ocean is an urgent investigation that combines science, business, and social justice. Through this lens, readers will come to understand the horrible effects that climate change and over-fishing are having on our oceans. If we don’t understand how tuna live, breed, and move around, especially in this era of increasing climate change, then we run the risk of watching them vanish like Atlantic cod and wild Atlantic Salmon. As Pinchin writes, “Now is the moment when we will get to choose whether we want to live in a world with tuna — or not.”Karen Pinchin is an award-winning investigative journalist and culinary school graduate. A recent Tow Fellow at PBS's Frontline, she graduated from Columbia Journalism School with a Master of Arts in science journalism and has since been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Sloan Foundation. Her work has appeared in Scientific American, Canadian Geographic, Hakai Magazine, The Globe and Mail, and The Walrus, among other outlets. She lives, writes, and fishes in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with her husband, son, and a tankful of guppies.Photo credit: Matt HorsemanSabrina Imbler is the author of the essay collection, How Far the Light Reaches and the chapbook Dyke (geology), which was chosen for the National Book Award's Science + Literature program.

Directed by Li Ruijun, the film had its world premiere at Berlinale 2022, subsequently reaching an impressive 100 million Yuan (US $14 million) box office sales as of September, 2022, on a low production budget of 2 million Yuan (US $275,000). However, shortly after its release in China in July, 2022, and despite the high praise it has received, the film was removed from cinemas and streaming platforms in China. WATCH THE TRAILER HERE.T﻿he film is due to release in the U.S. in select cities on July 21, 2023. Synopsis:In the small, rural village in Gaotai, two lonely, middle-aged people—Cao, a timid woman suffering from chronic illness and a disability, and Ma, an unassuming farmer with little to his name—are pushed into an arranged marriage by their respective families. Cast aside as burdens, Cao and Ma's relationship is tepid at first but warms as the two spend their days fixing up an abandoned house on their small patch of land. Invigorated by a shared purpose and the all-consuming nature of farm work, the couple's bond grows. However, in the dwindling rural communities of the Gansu province surrounding them, local farmers are being incentivized by local government to demolish their homes and uproot toward the cities. With their livelihood disappearing, the couple attempt to build a new life together with continued patience and determination toward their home and one another.""An elegiac story, a humanistic metaphor for a vanishing world seen through the prism of a vulnerable couple cruelly written off.” - Hollywood Reporter ""Art-house title “Return to Dust” was a surprise weekend winner, topping the mainland China box office in its ninth weekend of release."" - Variety""Seemingly banned merely for spotlighting the hard lives of the rural poor, the sleeper hit appears a snapshot of an airless political climate — and a symbol of the vulnerability of art."" - Financial Times ""Li Ruijun’s golden-hued film is a heartbreaking tale of love and resilience in the face of societal indifference and change."" - The Guardian"

These problems are compounded by climate change, which causes issues such as reduced habitable space and deepened inequality. However, city planners can build resilience into their communities by leveraging new management techniques and smart technologies to improve livability.

Small and medium-sized cities account for more than half of the global urban population, and they continue to exhibit significant growth. To accommodate everyone, city authorities must prioritize sustainable development with a focus on inclusivity, safety, affordability, and resilience. They must also integrate infrastructure investments and policy reforms into their plans. Fortunately, new digital technologies aid decision-making and enable transparent, people-centered, and accountable governance in smart cities. However, the financing gap remains significant in developing countries. Thus, authorities should leverage resources and create economic opportunities to narrow the gap.

In response to SDG7, SDG9, SDG11, and SDG17, this side event shares best practices on smart and sustainable policy reform, digital development, climate resilience, modern waste management and health system design, and financing strategies. Audience members will learn more about key factors that enhance livability and resilience for all citizens, as well as how city authorities, companies, and community partners can build smarter and more sustainable cities together.
P﻿urposeThis side event shares how the public and private sectors can cooperate to build cities that are more livable and resilient by implementing smart and sustainable solutions for everyone.M﻿oderatorDr. Yanis Ben Amor, Executive Director, Center for Sustainable Development in the Earth Institute, Columbia University.K﻿eynote SpeakerH﻿.E.

She asks the provocative question long ignored: Why do we value the indispensable atmosphere at zero, but dispensable production in the trillions? She digs into alternatives, with real-life examples from around the globe of fascinating and pioneering financial innovations—controversial and paradoxical, but essential. In the book, you’ll travel from rainforests to Wall Street, Board Rooms to the Vatican, coral reefs to mangroves to China’s carbon markets. Timely, adventurous, eclectic, and accessible, Pricing the Priceless brings alive the critical financial transformation that will determine future planetary health and social stability.With power, clarity and real-world experience, the author also examines:Fascinating new financial inventions and experiments—insurance, bonds, markets, investment funds—all aimed at pricing what is precious and vital to human well-beingHow the great current intergenerational shift in wealth and attitudes is redefining investment trends and the idea of what constitutes wealth and returnHow climate change and other urgent environmental problems now require entirely new financial thinking to trigger solutionsHow once-radical ideas about measuring economic progress are now re-imagining the very purpose of capitalismWhy finance needs critical re-invention to remain credible in the face of increasing public skepticism of business-as-usual economic practiceA can’t-miss read for thought leaders, business executives, investors, activists, and entrepreneurs, Pricing the Priceless is a landmark that will shape the world and future, bridging the tangible and intangible to answer a critical question of rising economic and social inspiration: What is money for?PAULA DIPERNA is a pioneer and leader at the forefront of finance and climate policy, from the Oval Office to Antarctica, coral reefs to carbon markets. She served as President of CCX International, the world’s first expansive emissions trading system to address global warming; President of the Joyce Foundation; and writer for underwater hero, Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Currently, she is Special Advisor to CDP, the world’s only integrated environmental disclosure system. DiPerna is a frequent media commentator and public speaker."

From tech to spiritual leadership and executive coaching, Tran has charted her own path by learning how to tune into her intuition and be true to her Inner Genius.Informed by ancient sources of wisdom like Zen, Reiki, astrology, and Stoicism, The Karma of Success invites you to validate the unique goals and ambitions you set for yourself and ultimately, are destined to achieve. You’ll learn the Four Pillars of Spiritual Strategy—inquiring inward, manifesting mindfully, enriching your energy, and becoming brilliant—and be guided by the stories of people who have looked inward to find meaning and success.So whether you’re trying to start your own business, heal your inner child, or just figure out how to get through the next Mercury in retrograde, The Karma of Success will help you find your way.Liz Tran is the founder of Reset, an executive coaching company to CEOs and founders.

In this workshop, we invite Jews, and our friends and allies, to look at ways that Jewish engagement with climate action can provide an opportunity for healing from antisemitism. We will share stories and artworks in celebration of Jewish connections with living environments, both past and present.  We will introduce tools of listening and of healing from inherited historical trauma.

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.”


At this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.


This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.  Abundant hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be served.

As global leaders gather in New York for the UN Climate Ambition Summit and General Assembly, we are calling on governments to reckon with their role in fueling climate chaos, and harm against frontline communities and the planet  by continuing the extraction of fossil fuels . We only have a limited amount of years left to address and mitigate the worst impacts of the  climate crisis.

For years, global climate movements have been calling for governments to phase out fossil fuels and stop expansion. We continue to pressure governments, corporations, and financial institutions to adhere to the demands of  science and communities, and implement an immediate equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. Instead, governments must invest in and deploy a Just Transition that is grounded in a climate justice framework and uplifts care economies, community-led solutions, Indigenous rights,  and a different vision than business as usual.

During this event,  we will host two panels, please see below for descriptions.

“Women Ending the Era of Fossil Fuels”
During this panel discussion, global women leaders will share expertise and frameworks for transitioning away from extraction and  share ongoing policy advocacy and campaigns that seek to phase out fossil fuels, deforestation, and other harmful extractive practices. 

“Women-led Climate Solutions Are Central to a Just Transition and Thriving  Future”
In the second panel we will hear from  global women leaders and policy experts on how to implement and support  solutions that are advancing  a Just Transition. Speakers will share demonstrated successes of women’s leadership in reducing emissions, stopping fossil fuel extraction and deforestation, and implementing just community-led climate solutions.

We will also need to build close relationships with each other to support each other in our climate work and do so in a culture that systematically divides and separates us.Sustaining All Life calls this movement against a “normal” culture of conformity, passivity, overconsumption, isolation, and numbness “Mental Health Liberation.”In this workshop you will learn:·		 How normality is defined by the behaviors most desirable by profiteering interests;·		 How our societies and institutions enforce conformity and make people less likely to act against authority or resist oppression;·		 A Mental Health Liberation framework for understanding human upset beyond the medical (mental illness/mental health) and consumer models;·		 Practical tools for dealing with the emotions that come up when we face the climate emergency and challenge societal norms; and·		 A format for exchanging care with each other that creates the safety we need to show ourselves and build closer relationships.Understanding how our societies and institutions define and enforce normality is key to making the big changes we need to make. Please join us as we take this on together."

With games like Energetic, Climate Fresk and DayBreak.https://newyork.thecityatlas.org/energetic/If we are to confront the climate crisis at scale, we will need to collaborate and coordinate across fields, neighborhoods, cultures and industries. A serious energy transition demands such coordination (that’s what Energetic the game teaches us). Collaborative games and policy making forums (such as deliberative citizens’ assemblies) point the way forward to enable us to do this at scale. They orient participants towards longterm goals and enable them to work through scenarios of the coming decades, in order to discuss what policies will be most efficient and successful at reducing emissions while maintaining public support."

Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone."

This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.
