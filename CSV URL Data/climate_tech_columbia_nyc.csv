https://www.climate.columbia.edu/events/ws-jardetzky-lecture,"The Jardetzky lecture in geophysics honors the late Wenceslas S. Jardetzky, a renowned researcher and educator whose flourishing scientific career in Europe was halted by World War II and revived after he emigrated to the United States. From 1949 until his death in 1962, he was a research associate at Lamont-Doherty, where he collaborated with Frank Press, former president of the National Academy of Sciences, and Maurice Ewing, Lamont-Doherty's founder, on a well-known and widely used scientific book, Elastic Waves in Layered Media.
Dr. Jardetzky's broad scope of scientific interests also included celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, theoretical physics, seismology, and the migration of the poles. A principal contribution to science was his mathematical theory on zonal rotation, which provided a mechanism for the migration of continents.
The Jardetzky lecture was established in 1992 by Dr. Jardetzky's son Oleg, who was the founder of the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and professor of molecular pharmacology at Stanford University. In endowing the lectureship, Dr. Jardetzky said he hoped it would ""help enrich the outstanding tradition of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which provided a much cherished intellectual home to my father after he emigrated to this country.""

In discussions on Just Transition, green jobs become the priority. However this roundtable discussion will take the dialogue beyond jobs into life-skills. Green jobs and greening of the transition is just piece of the puzzle, but the larger share is our collective commitment towards the planet. To foster this commitment, global citizenship education provides the pathways to take care of our planet and all living beings. Therefore this round table discussion will include green jobs needed for livelihoods, but it also include all the elements of SDG target 4.7 which talks about the role of education in a peaceful and prosperous planet.
