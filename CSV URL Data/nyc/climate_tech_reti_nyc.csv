A special event in support of New York Water Week and the UN Water Summit

Suggested donation: $55 with box lunch includedPURCHASE TICKETSNew Yorks's coastlines are rebounding with kelp farms, constructed salt marshes, floating gardens, and access for low-income populations, all built by community activists, but ecological restoration and environmental justice still aren't a priority for the city's megaprojects. Tour the East River from Bronx Kill Park to Gowanus Bay with community and environmental justice activists to see their remarkable revitalization projects as guide you  through the past, present and future of New York’s coastline and marginalized communities. New York Harbor is the 6th Borough, the defining feature and least empowered part of the metropolis. Learn how a community-driven response to the changing climate and a transition to a carbon-free economy can catalyze an equitable and sustainable future for our collective benefit.This 3-hour guided boat tour will take us from 34th St Ferry Landing to the Bronx, future site of South Bronx Unite’s Bronx Kill Park and then return downriver to Red Hook, Brooklyn to RETI Center’s BlueCity at GBX~ Gowanus Bay Terminal. The afternoon will be spent with advocates and activists representing communities along the East River and NY NJ Harbor Estuary who have expertise and knowledge on how large-scale infrastructure must meet the needs of our local citizens and ecosystems. We will be discussing NYC and other metropolis-scale plans for sea level rise and climate events. The focus will be on nature-based solutions, equitable access, and visionary solutions that can benefit all species in the face of hard infrastructure proposals such as the US Army Corps of Engineers Harbor & Tributaries Focus Area Feasibility Study [HATS]."
