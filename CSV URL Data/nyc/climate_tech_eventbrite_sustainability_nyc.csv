Pamphlets and examples of darning, mending, and sashiko-inspired stitching, as well as materials will be provided. Please bring yourself (and maybe a friend) and an object you wish to mend.The history of mending and mending techniques in my practice has become a more specific facet of my ongoing interest in the gendering of fine art vs. craft throughout the centuries. The detailed hand stitching of mending scars naturally display the intimate relationship and innate sustainability humans used to have with their clothes. The very act of mending a textile today becomes a form of resistance in itself: resistance to the relationship- or lack thereof- we have with our belongings we are so quick to discard. When one actively chooses to mend a garment, saving it from the landfill, a relationship is thus formed. ‘Darn it’, like any mending act, looks to intervene in the rapid death cycle of consuming clothing today, and to help foster deeper relationships with one's objects as a whole. - b﻿y Martina CoxI﻿nstructions from 'Mend! A Refashioning Manual and Manifesto' by Kate Sekules will be provided.Martina Cox is an artist based out of New York City. After graduating from the Cooper Union in 2018, Martina founded her eponymous clothing label, selling one-off garments made to order as a way to uphold slow fashion values. Since closing her business in 2021, Martina has continued to make work about fashion history and craft through Sculpture, Drawing and Performance. She hosts a monthly mending club that addresses ways we can heal relationships with objects we often deem as disposable.H﻿ekima Hapa is a Fashion Designer, social entrepreneur, author and Founder of the 22 year sustainable independent fashion brand inspired by Africa and the people of its diaspora, Harriet’s Alter Ego also known as Harriet’s by Hekima.

We are so excited to have a series of 4 workshops happening between now and June that highlight the different techniques we can use to upcycle and bring to life textile waste! Join us for our last workshop on June 22nd at 6:30pm at the FABSCRAP Warehouse to turn scraps into rug masterpieces! The use of turning old clothes and cloth into rugs as a practice that can be seen in a variety of cultures. Rag rugs became widespread during the Industrial Revolution to the nineteenth century, especially in Sweden and Amish communities.  Boucherouite, (pronounced boo-shay-REET) a word derived from a Moroccan-Arabic phrase for torn and reused clothing. This unique sustainable rug practice began around the mid-20th century in the Atlas mountain region of Morocco. Instead of using more traditional materials like wool to weave rugs, artisans would use recycled rugs, clothing, nylon, plastic and even packaging materials to create truly one of a kind textiles.  In this workshop students will learn how they can recycle textiles to create new one of a kind pieces. A﻿ll materials will be provided by TAC and FABSCRAP <3All tickets are non-refundable. We encourage you to consider donating as another way to support our work as a sustainable resource - FABSCRAP is the only option available for the fashion industry to recycle and redistribute unused material, and the most accessible way for consumers to find saved-from-landfill fabric, trim, leather, and yarn.Artist Bio:Emma Redmond is a textile artist and teacher who creates handcrafted, one of a kind pieces for the home and adornment. All of her pieces incorporate hand sewing, reflecting her love of traditional methods, as well as her fear of technology. Many of her sewing and design techniques are also used in her quilt making practice. Her work is influenced by American folk art, near east textiles as well as a love of kitsch. She lives and works in her hometown of Brooklyn, New York. When she is not quilting or weaving she can be found teaching youth programs at Textile Arts Center. @emma__redmondTextile Arts Center (TAC) is a NYC-based resource facility dedicated to raising awareness and understanding of textiles through creative educational programs for children and adults. At TAC, we unite and empower the textile community and advocate for the handmade by providing accessible, skills-based classes that reinvigorate engagement with traditional crafts. Techniques like weaving, sewing, and dyeing are practical, connective, and process-driven—common denominators around the world. They are part of our collective history and vital to our ongoing expressions of design, art, and culture.We appreciate the unique values of textile arts and want to expand opportunities for new practitioners to engage with the medium. Experiential learning is the foundation of our model and enables students from all backgrounds to make meaningful contributions to a growing community of fiber artists. By engaging with groups ranging from newcomers to experts, we increase the positive social impact of textile arts and nurture innovations and leadership in the field.FABSCRAP is a 501(c)3 nonprofit working to end commercial textile ""waste.""

In unseren interaktiven Halbtages-Workshops erfahren Sie, wie Sie die Transformation hin zum nachhaltigen Wirtschaften in Ihrer Organisation strategisch angehen.Die sustainabiltiyCAMPS können einzeln oder als Serie besucht werden. Der Entwicklungsstatus des Unternehmens oder Startups spielt keine Rolle.Gehören Sie zu den Pionieren und stellen sie ihr Unternehmen zukunftsfähig auf - wir freuen uns auf Sie!#4 Nachhaltigkeitsorientierte UnternehmenskulturUnternehmenszweck, Werte, Verhalten: dieser Dreiklang prägt die Kultur von Unternehmen und damit auch die Fähigkeit, sich an verändernde Rahmenbedingungen anzupassen bzw. sich zukunftsorientiert auszurichten.

With a focus in restorative justice, Nando is working to take local composting to another level of community support and push local representatives to deepen participation in NYC. Discussion and questions are enthusiastically encouraged - bring questions along with you! Light snacks and refreshments will be provided.Nando Rodriguez was born and raised in the Lower East Side and the Dominican Republic. Raised in a single-parent household, his mother raised 6 children (older sisters helped with the little ones) and he was the youngest. His mother's reasoning to send him away for a portion of his life was her fear of Nando following in the footsteps of his elder brothers, who were caught between the street life of Alphabet City. Nando spent 5 years in Bonao, D.R. He always felt the need to help others, especially his peers who were less fortunate, and in D.R. he would create spaces for his peers to play games, often inviting youth from other communities to join. Nando eventually returned to NYC and enrolled in East Side Community High School. It was there that he was introduced to Open Road of NY, as well as The Brotherhood Sister Sol. With Open Road of NY, Nando started to connect his purpose on Earth with Mother Earth and began to assist Open Road with the development of the HotBox. Nando also worked on green space designing with participants of these selected communities using the Participatory Designed process and developing or redesigning green spaces for community engagement. With The Brotherhood Sister Sol, Nando continues to empower youth to become leaders in their communities. Through love, support, resources and guidance, The Brotherhood Sister Sol team is able to create a Rites of Passage experience for all youth to question what's not clear to them and speak up when they feel their voice is not being heard.

Seating is limited and will be first come, first served. Doors open at 5:30 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.

The work of Pritzker Prize–winning architect Thom Mayne and that of the firm Morphosis at its most pure is best seen in the models that preceded the buildings, masterworks made at scale, for the first time comprehensively gathered—and shown here.

Thom Mayne is a deeply theoretical and conceptual architect whose built work and that of the firm Morphosis can be seen worldwide. On the cutting edge of exploration and discovery in design, the architecture is marked by complexity, disruption, ambiguity, and power. In each case, prior to the building came the model, which may serve as a key to understanding and appreciation; models express purely the basis of Mayne’s theory and intention. This volume offers, for the first time ever, an exhaustive look at the models upon which all the rest has been built, and is, as well, an essential history of the work of Mayne and Morphosis. A forty-plus-year office retrospective and a love letter to models, their process and concepts, and those that made them, the book considers at once the evolution of the model and that of the work of the firm. It features small-scale dwellings, such as the early and award-winning Sedlack Residence in Venice, California—a single room and study set atop a one-car garage—to Unicorn Island, a mixed-use master plan including a transit station, university campus, commerical and office buildings, parks, and green space in Chengdu, China.

In addition to models never before documented, the book includes outside commentary from architecture historians, critics, and practicing architects, such as Kenneth Frampton, Steven Holl, and Wolf Prix.THOM MAYNE is founding partner of Morphosis, an interdisciplinary and collective architecture and planning practice established in 1972. Mayne’s distinguished honors include the Pritzker Prize (2005) and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2013). He served on the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities from 2009–2016. In 1972, he cofounded the Southern California Institute of Architecture, where he continues to lead the NOW Institute, a graduate-level thinktank for urban sustainability and resilience. Mayne has held teaching positions at Columbia, Yale, the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the Bartlett School of Architecture in London, and the University of Pennsylvania. Recent publications include Strange Networks (2020, Rizzoli), a monograph highlighting his exploration of combinatory systems, and M3 (2023, Rizzoli), a survey of fifty years of models at Morphosis. This investigation continues at Stray Dog Café, Mayne’s personal art and research space at Morphosis, where he leads a team of young designers and students on research projects, the creation of artworks, and the development of publications that document their creative output. SFMOMA, MoMA, and The Art Institute of Chicago, among others, hold artworks produced throughout his career.WINKA DUBBELDAM is the founder and partner of the WBE certified firm Archi-Tectonics NYC LLC.  widely known for their award-winning work, recognized as much for its design excellence as for its use of smart building systems, sustainable materials, and innovative structures.

Held in the spectacular, one-of-a-kind setting of wildflower meadows stretching across the roofs of an industrial plant against the iconic backdrop of the NYC skyline, the event will be centered around a Sufi opening ritual honoring nature's cycles, performed by Whirling Dervish Farima Berenji. Farima—a Sufi Master and Magi and her sacred dancers will be accompanied by the klezmer music and Sephardic folk melodies of The Shul Band. The ceremony has been designed as a unique blend of Muslim and Jewish elements—epitomizing the possibility of interfaith collaboration. The main event will involve solo acts, duets and a whirling performance in which several participants—including Cyr wheelers—will interpret the movements of individual planets around a star. The show will also feature poetry readings and storytelling by Master Farima and be accompanied by the live music of the Shul Band. Following the whirlers’ performances, The Shul Band will keep playing against the darkening night sky.Farima Berenji is an internationally acclaimed dance artist, ethnologist, choreographer, instructor, and archaeologist specializing in ancient, sacred, classical, and folk dances spanning the millenniums of Persian civilization, the Silk Road, and the Near East.The Shul Band, led by Adam Feder, plays music rooted in Jewish folk music but drawing on the musical wellsprings of New York City and of the whole world. It is equally prayerful and raucous, meditative and joyful. The band has performed at major venues such as Carnegie Hall.The Solstice celebration will be the opening event of NOoSPHERE Arts’ WE ARE NATURE: Rising and Falling—the fourth iteration of the nonprofit’s annual rooftop series. Each season’s theme references an aspect of systems thinking, an approach to environmental sustainability spearheaded by leading thinker Fritjof Capra, a longtime NOoSPHERE Arts collaborator. This view considers all the major problems of our time—including energy, economics, climate change, and inequality—as interconnected and interdependent. In 2023, the summer series explores the theme of Nature’s Cycles. A cycle is an interval of time during which a characteristic event occurs, often repeated regularly or in a sequence of events. There are cycles in everything—seasons, circadian rhythms, cellular life, planetary systems, politics, and economics—and cycles in one realm affect cycles in others. Thinking about cycles can help us to discern structure, order, and patterns in the world around us, and to realize that everything in life will ebb and flow—an encouraging thought in times of darkness.In addition we will also unveil the highly anticipated site-specific installation by this season's KWBS Residency Award winners, Ezra Campelli and Jeremy Clemente. Prepare to be amazed by ""Westerlies,"" a mesmerizing fusion of sound and sculpture meticulously crafted for the Kingsland Wildflowers Green Roofs. Don't miss this extraordinary event, kicking off NOoSPHERE Arts' WE ARE NATURE: Rising and Falling rooftop series. Join us as we explore the theme of Nature's Cycles, reminding us that everything in life ebbs and flows."

Its mission is to restore oyster reefs to New York Harbor through public education initiatives in order to create a future in which New York Harbor is the center of a rich, diverse, and abundant estuary. Oysters have a remarkable ability to filter nitrogen pollution from water as they eat, earning them the nickname “ecosystem engineers” because we see biodiversity levels increase dramatically surrounding oyster reefs, and the belief is that restoring oysters and reefs will, over time, restore the local marine ecosystem’s natural mechanisms for maintaining itself, resulting in cleaner water and greater biodiversity.Testimonials""Montana was an excellent tour guide I learned a lot"" -Richard""I liked everything, interesting, educational and fun"" -Kathleen""Great all around activity."" -Ben""﻿Access to & information about a place in NYC that was something I didn't know much about"" -Adrienne""﻿Educational: How oysters can help clean environment.

This technique is used for printing everything from t-shirts, posters, fabric yardage, and fine art. Screen printing is a process where ink is transferred through a mesh screen. The screen has an image or stencil which blocks ink in certain areas. Ink goes through the unblocked parts of the screen when a squeegee passes over which transfers the image onto fabric of paper.In this workshop students will learn basic screen printing techniques for fabric printing using fabric from FABSCRAP!A﻿ll materials will be provided by TAC and FABSCRAP <3All tickets are non-refundable.

We consider new technologies for extraction and sourcing, new mine-to-market models, and new approaches to training, whether the next generation of jewelers or miners.

Our goal is clear: together, we need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and stop burning fossil fuels. And we need to do this in a way that is equitable and just. Any one of the thousands of jobs that help with that is a climate career! You could focus on reducing GHG emissions in buildings - working in designing, construction, or clean energy. Or you could manage green space, by working in natural areas or agriculture. You might help us move toward “circularity” - reducing waste through repairing goods or reusing materials. Or you may help your community be more resilient. This means reducing peoples’ vulnerability to climate hazards.  Maybe you want to be an educator and teach people about climate change, or you love economics and want to help finance solutions. Maybe you’ll invent a solution no one knows about yet!  Whatever your interests, there is a climate career path for you. Participating Organizations We'll have representatives from over 20 different organizations, all focused on environment, climate, or green industries. Come learn about the different opportunities available in the NYC area and speak to workers who are taking climate action in their jobs!Student-Led WorkshopsW﻿e have optional, student-led workshops:Climate Communications in Your School Upcycling Workshop W﻿e'll also have a keynote speaker to talk about being a young climate professional, and activities like an eco-book swap!

Partnering with Madison Boys and Girls Club as well as Head Start North Bronx they bring reliable healthy meals to the community’s youngest mouths.Along the way we will meet Simone of Green and Blue Eco Care for a deeper look at the green spaces in East Harlem. Simone is a tree steward who uses her vast knowledge to clean up and green up the community. Her efforts began as “guerilla gardening” and now she works in coordination with the parks department to maintain tree pits, plant new street trees, and maintain a pollinator garden. She facilitates a street-clean up as we make our way through East Harlem.No tour would be complete without an expert tour guide to bring the destination to life. You will be led through the historic and cultural past and present of Harlem with the one and only Lady Altovise! Altovise has over 20 years of experience guiding in NYC, and has called Harlem home since she first moved to the city. “I was drawn to Harlem in the 6th grade… we had to learn a Langston Hughes poem. Mine was ” Mother to Son”. Little did I know my family had been quoting this poem all of my life!”"
