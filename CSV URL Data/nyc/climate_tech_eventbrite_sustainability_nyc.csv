All that's required is an open mind and a willingness to be compassionate and supportive. Plan for 60 minutes on Sunday, from 12:00-1:00 PM EASTERN.This workshop is for you if: You're naturally everyone else's biggest cheerleader, and you're ready to prioritize being your own.  You need to remember how to make time for yourself. And you've grown accustomed to being on auto-pilot as you tend to the needs of everyone around you.  You're looking for a process that will guide you into a sustainable journaling practice that celebrates you. You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals. ANYONE CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER, BUT BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE JOURNALING PRACTICE THAT'S FUN REQUIRES CONSISTENCY. Are you ready to explore what journaling that celebrates yourself could look and feel like for you? Sign up today, check your email for details, and arrive ready to go all in! I can't wait to connect with you. ~ Claire"

O﻿n day one, we will begin with a quick material & joinery discussion to foreground our cabinet-making, covering uses for hardwood vs plywood, and tongue / groove / rabbet 101s. We will then move into machine safety & set up for dimensioning & grooving our face frame parts. With our groove made, we will set up for putting a tongue on our plywood parts, testing for accuracy with both feel and measurements. We will have all cabinet parts cut & joinery completed, and will have covered the jointer, planer, router table & table saw with dado stack on day one.At the beginning of day two, we will begin by combining cabinet parts, learning about best glue up practices along the way, and then begin hand-sketching our cabinets to build, with dropped-down dimensions. Participants are encouraged to consider a space in their homes or offices for this small cabinet to live, and design accordingly. When ready, we'll begin cutting down our cabinet parts to final dimension, marking for through and pilot holes, and finish by screwing them together. By then end of our second day, we will have covered proper form with clamps, gluing & drills (screwguns), as well as further table saw practice. This is a great class for those new to woodworking, or those interested in brushing up on their essentials skills in a safe, supportive environment. While geared towards those who have used some (though perhaps not all) of these machines or processes before, beginners eager to dive right in are absolutely welcome. We will be moving at a quick pace, and any and all questions are greatly encouraged, especially the ones we’ve been taught to think we should already know the answer to.This class is welcoming to all, especially those traditionally underrepresented in the field of woodworking- in particular those who identify as female, trans*, non-binary & gender non-conforming, BIPOC, queer, disabled. Please reach out to the instructor in advance of class to discuss accommodations.

In infinite collaborative incarnations, she helms progressive art rock project gushes— songwriting and composition rooted in rhythmic guitar loops and ritualized theatre with a stylistic range encompassing chamber rock ensemble, experimental drone, movement cycle, sound sculpture, and more. Santos’ work is influenced by Indigenous Filipino psychology, Kali as a decolonized combat art, the feminist occult, plant medicine and ecology, BIPOC land revolution movements, genderqueer fluidity, and pleasure autonomy.With the aim to cultivate space for collective trust and shared dreaming, Tree+Oyster arrive with non verbal communication and play to shed anthropocentric perspective and facilitate opportunities for emergent ritual.Tree+Oyster merge archipelagic Indigenous mythologies from the Dominican Republic and the Philippines in order to stoke memory, resist erasure, and generate new mythologies. We are curious to discover cross-cultural parallels in land-water relationship between Indigenous communities and our own personal decolonization research. We engage in immersive research deepening our relationship to land and community. From this foundation, we facilitate creative gatherings bridging inner and outer ecologies — a practice in tuning our personal, communal, and digital relationship to the landscape.Site-specific gatherings consist of co-creation exercises and games, sensorial ceremonies, body mapping, collective altar building, and musical forest jams. Seasonal elements, i.e. sand, snow, and vegetation, inform the location and structure of interactive installations. These onsite activations create a generative mediated space for communal storytelling.Rooted in the study of Indigenous histories, local-to-global community, and ecology, Tree+Oyster aims to build a cross-cultural campfire generating warmth, in empathetic pursuit of sustainability."

It was only in the year 2000 they started to remember who they really are through communing with their sacred medicine nixi pae (ayahuasca) within their community. Their identity has since returned after more than the 20 years of prayers and cultural strengthening undertaken by the spiritual leader Ninawá Pai da Mata and his village Novo Futuro, and the communities along the Humaitá River. Through this film, we are guided by the villagers through the enchanting cacophony of the forest, understanding the significance of culture and identity to the Huni Kuin people. Speakers: Lara Jacoski is a documentarist, co-director of Bem-te-vi Produções together with Patrick Belem, a 10 years Brazilian independent film production company making collaborations across the 5 continents (AF/AS/EU/NAM/LATAM). Lara has deepened her work in ethnographic projects focused to register culture referring to ancestral knowledge.

Such coexistence with the peoples has changed her life and ways of perceiving reality bringing a whole different level of her work. Her current project ""Living Libraries"" is an ongoing series to register traditional people's wisdom from Brazil and beyond.S﻿peakers: Joseph Mays received his MSc in Ethnobotany from the University of Kent researching responses to globalization by the Yanesha of central Peru. Graduating with biology and anthropology degrees from Virginia Commonwealth University, he published a medicinal plant guide for the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve in the Ecuadorian cloud forest. Joseph also holds a certificate in Psychedelic Assisted Therapies from Naropa University, and his conservation work explores how cultural-conditioning influences approaches to biocultural sustainability. His Indigenous rights advocacy stresses the importance of ground-up structures that emphasize local agency and challenge conventional philanthropic models in attempts to support Indigenous autonomy and biodiversity. Joseph is Program Director of Chacruna’s  Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative  (IRI), where he partners with Indigenous community organizations throughout the Americas to support Chacruna’s mission of increasing cultural reciprocity in the psychedelic space, raising unconditional funding and engaging with local stakeholders on their own terms.[﻿Main Credits] Director : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemD.O.P : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemIn association with: Ninawá Pai da Mata and Txai Vinícius Yube Ika Ni BaiProduction: Bem-te-vi ProduçoesCo-Producer : Joakim Vocke Hauge (Hinterland)Executive producer: Oona Chaplin (Double Rainbow Productions), Torstein Grude (Piraya), Alex Moreno (Cine-Creative Media)Co-executive producers: Lucía Alonso, Bodhi Kaya, Coco Amos and Kristen NicoleSound: Origens Sound Farm – Andreia FreireM﻿usic: The Huni Kuin PeopleMain cast: Ninawá Pai Da Mata, Ikamuru Huni Kuin, Yube Dua Bake, Txana Tuwe, Dua Buse Dua Bake / Huni Kuin indigenous people.This work received grants from the Brazilian Show Me The Fund (powered by Brazilian Content, Cinema do Brasil, Projeto Paradiso) plus a 2 years support of international collective funding."

Oysters have a remarkable ability to filter nitrogen pollution from water as they eat, earning them the nickname “ecosystem engineers” because we see biodiversity levels increase dramatically surrounding oyster reefs, and the belief is that restoring oysters and reefs will, over time, restore the local marine ecosystem’s natural mechanisms for maintaining itself, resulting in cleaner water and greater biodiversity.Testimonials""Montana was an excellent tour guide I learned a lot"" -Richard""I liked everything, interesting, educational and fun"" -Kathleen""Great all around activity."" -Ben""﻿Access to & information about a place in NYC that was something I didn't know much about"" -Adrienne""﻿Educational: How oysters can help clean environment.

Tackling these emissions is critical if we are to make Net Zero a reality, and while large corporates are setting Scope 3 targets and committing to decarbonizing their value chains, many businesses are still struggling to take action.Scope 3 emissions are by nature a collective challenge, and a complex one. Getting  answers and solutions to achieve Scope 3 emission reductions and credibly report on the impact achieved is an absolute priority, and it has been a key focus of the Value Change Initiative since 2017. Since then, we have focused on making Scope 3 operationable trough the implementation of Market Based Mechanisms. On September 20, join us for Climate Week’s premier Scope 3 event.
