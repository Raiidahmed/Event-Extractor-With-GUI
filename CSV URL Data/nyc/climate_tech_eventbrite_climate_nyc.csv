These problems are compounded by climate change, which causes issues such as reduced habitable space and deepened inequality. However, city planners can build resilience into their communities by leveraging new management techniques and smart technologies to improve livability.

Small and medium-sized cities account for more than half of the global urban population, and they continue to exhibit significant growth. To accommodate everyone, city authorities must prioritize sustainable development with a focus on inclusivity, safety, affordability, and resilience. They must also integrate infrastructure investments and policy reforms into their plans. Fortunately, new digital technologies aid decision-making and enable transparent, people-centered, and accountable governance in smart cities. However, the financing gap remains significant in developing countries. Thus, authorities should leverage resources and create economic opportunities to narrow the gap.

In response to SDG7, SDG9, SDG11, and SDG17, this side event shares best practices on smart and sustainable policy reform, digital development, climate resilience, modern waste management and health system design, and financing strategies.

Jewelry is our lens, with a twin focus on artistry and responsible practice. A focus, we suggest, unique to IAC.All of us, from those upstream in supply chains to those realizing an artistic vision in fine jewelry, must maintain purpose: we must do the work, ever-committed to effecting the change we seek.Thus, conscious of the imperative to balance the needs of current and future generations, we explore varied declarations of purpose and principle on responsible practice and cultural preservation and how to harmonize and operationalize them, taking action, driven by aspiration. We consider new technologies for extraction and sourcing, new mine-to-market models, and new approaches to training, whether the next generation of jewelers or miners. Always with an eye to meeting evolving environmental and climate challenges.Perhaps most fundamentally, we investigate the critical question of what constitutes luxury in an age of responsible practice.During the conference, IAC will present its 6th annual award for Leadership in Responsible Practice and 3rd annual award for Extraordinary Contributions to the Diamond and Jewelry Industries.The conference kicks off with a welcoming reception at Heritage Auctions New York located at 445 Park Avenue with remarks by Roberta Kramer, Vice President, Strategy & Business Development at Heritage.

It's the story of one enormous tuna and the dedicated fisherman who first tagged her. Dubbed Amelia (for her transatlantic journey), this fish was first caught off the New England coast by an enigmatic man named Al Anderson. Though a lifelong professional fisherman, Anderson did not see fish simply as a means to a paycheck. Rather, he understood that his own livelihood depended on that of the fish he caught. In riveting detail, Pinchin follows the story of how Al's obsession - he tagged over 60,000 fish in his lifetime -  made him just as many enemies as it did friends, as he existed in the unique and often tense space between a booming bluefin tuna industry and science-fueled conservation efforts. Kings of Their Own Ocean is an urgent investigation that combines science, business, and social justice. Through this lens, readers will come to understand the horrible effects that climate change and over-fishing are having on our oceans. If we don’t understand how tuna live, breed, and move around, especially in this era of increasing climate change, then we run the risk of watching them vanish like Atlantic cod and wild Atlantic Salmon. As Pinchin writes, “Now is the moment when we will get to choose whether we want to live in a world with tuna — or not.”Karen Pinchin is an award-winning investigative journalist and culinary school graduate. A recent Tow Fellow at PBS's Frontline, she graduated from Columbia Journalism School with a Master of Arts in science journalism and has since been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Sloan Foundation. Her work has appeared in Scientific American, Canadian Geographic, Hakai Magazine, The Globe and Mail, and The Walrus, among other outlets.

Directed by Li Ruijun, the film had its world premiere at Berlinale 2022, subsequently reaching an impressive 100 million Yuan (US $14 million) box office sales as of September, 2022, on a low production budget of 2 million Yuan (US $275,000). However, shortly after its release in China in July, 2022, and despite the high praise it has received, the film was removed from cinemas and streaming platforms in China. WATCH THE TRAILER HERE.T﻿he film is due to release in the U.S. in select cities on July 21, 2023. Synopsis:In the small, rural village in Gaotai, two lonely, middle-aged people—Cao, a timid woman suffering from chronic illness and a disability, and Ma, an unassuming farmer with little to his name—are pushed into an arranged marriage by their respective families. Cast aside as burdens, Cao and Ma's relationship is tepid at first but warms as the two spend their days fixing up an abandoned house on their small patch of land. Invigorated by a shared purpose and the all-consuming nature of farm work, the couple's bond grows. However, in the dwindling rural communities of the Gansu province surrounding them, local farmers are being incentivized by local government to demolish their homes and uproot toward the cities. With their livelihood disappearing, the couple attempt to build a new life together with continued patience and determination toward their home and one another.""An elegiac story, a humanistic metaphor for a vanishing world seen through the prism of a vulnerable couple cruelly written off.” - Hollywood Reporter ""Art-house title “Return to Dust” was a surprise weekend winner, topping the mainland China box office in its ninth weekend of release."" - Variety""Seemingly banned merely for spotlighting the hard lives of the rural poor, the sleeper hit appears a snapshot of an airless political climate — and a symbol of the vulnerability of art."" - Financial Times ""Li Ruijun’s golden-hued film is a heartbreaking tale of love and resilience in the face of societal indifference and change."" - The Guardian"

She asks the provocative question long ignored: Why do we value the indispensable atmosphere at zero, but dispensable production in the trillions? She digs into alternatives, with real-life examples from around the globe of fascinating and pioneering financial innovations—controversial and paradoxical, but essential. In the book, you’ll travel from rainforests to Wall Street, Board Rooms to the Vatican, coral reefs to mangroves to China’s carbon markets. Timely, adventurous, eclectic, and accessible, Pricing the Priceless brings alive the critical financial transformation that will determine future planetary health and social stability.With power, clarity and real-world experience, the author also examines:Fascinating new financial inventions and experiments—insurance, bonds, markets, investment funds—all aimed at pricing what is precious and vital to human well-beingHow the great current intergenerational shift in wealth and attitudes is redefining investment trends and the idea of what constitutes wealth and returnHow climate change and other urgent environmental problems now require entirely new financial thinking to trigger solutionsHow once-radical ideas about measuring economic progress are now re-imagining the very purpose of capitalismWhy finance needs critical re-invention to remain credible in the face of increasing public skepticism of business-as-usual economic practiceA can’t-miss read for thought leaders, business executives, investors, activists, and entrepreneurs, Pricing the Priceless is a landmark that will shape the world and future, bridging the tangible and intangible to answer a critical question of rising economic and social inspiration: What is money for?PAULA DIPERNA is a pioneer and leader at the forefront of finance and climate policy, from the Oval Office to Antarctica, coral reefs to carbon markets. She served as President of CCX International, the world’s first expansive emissions trading system to address global warming; President of the Joyce Foundation; and writer for underwater hero, Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Currently, she is Special Advisor to CDP, the world’s only integrated environmental disclosure system. DiPerna is a frequent media commentator and public speaker."

I want to transform a lovely summer Sunday stroll through this world famous park into a journey through 500 million years of earth's history.

The distance we will cover walking is approximately 1.5 miles. I've scheduled the tour for evening hours to hopefully reduce the stress of the heat.

Antisemitism, however,  has historically led to Jews losing our multi-generational connections to the many lands in which we have existed.  Recognizing and restoring those connections within our cultures is a key part of healing from antisemitism. In this workshop, we invite Jews, and our friends and allies, to look at ways that Jewish engagement with climate action can provide an opportunity for healing from antisemitism. We will share stories and artworks in celebration of Jewish connections with living environments, both past and present.  We will introduce tools of listening and of healing from inherited historical trauma. These tools can help to expand our involvement and sustain our action as Jews in the work to reverse the climate emergency, in coalition with many other peoples."

Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone."

This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.
