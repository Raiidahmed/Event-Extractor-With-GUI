Carmel Oratory (St. Teresa of Calcutta Parish) and the Community Outreach Program  have partnered to host a community storytelling gathering on Sunday, June 11, at 3pm at the auditorium of the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Oratory. Join us with your kids for this inspirational event. When it comes to making this world a better place, we can see how our children can make a difference at any age.Readers will be sharing beautiful and inspirational stories about children who transformed our world by promoting social justice, sustainability in economically disadvantaged communities, race and gender equality, and environmental protection.Come hear their amazing inspirational stories, and your children may want to share their own!Among the readings will be the story of Kelvin Doe, one of Sierra Leon's most famous inventors; Marley Dias, the activist behind the #1000BlackGirlBooks twitter phenomenon; worldwide environmental activist Greta Thunberg.Jaylen Arnold is one of the featured children. After being diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome, Asperger's and OCD, Jaylen was bullied by peers. The bullying worsened the symptoms of his disabilities.  That led Jaylen to found the Jaylen Challenge Foundation, which has educated more than 100,000 kids on recognizing bullying behavior and understanding each other differences.Another featured story is that of Malala Yousafzai, who at 17 became the youngest Nobel Prize laureate for her humanitarian efforts and advocacy for women education. There is also Sophie Cruz, who made a name for herself at five years old when she visited Washington D.C. with her family. Representing an L.A. based immigration advocacy group, they delivered a letter to Pope Francis urging him to speak out on behalf of undocumented immigrants. The Pope discussed the issue in a meeting with Congress the following day, and Cruz's activism earned her a meeting with President Obama.The Northeast Earth Coalition is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt, and volunteer driven non-profit organization.

There is a reduction in tuition fee and savings for accommodation. You will be required to help out over the 5 day event including the open house on August 17th.info@academysacredgeometry.comSacred Geometry is a study of the universal language of truth, harmony, beauty, proportion, rhythm and order.  It is a blueprint of creation, an interface between the seen and unseen, the manifest and un-manifest. It is often described as the Architect of the Universe. Sacred Geometry is a term used to describe the patterns, shapes, and proportions found in nature and the cosmos, which are believed to have spiritual and metaphysical significance. It is the study of the inherent order and symmetry present in the universe. These geometric patterns are fundamental to understanding the nature of reality, and that they can help us unlock the secrets of the universe.Certain geometric shapes and ratios have specific energetic properties. For example, the golden ratio (also known as phi) is a mathematical ratio that appears frequently in nature, from the spirals of seashells to the proportions of the human body. We will deep-dive into a visual and educational extravaganza of how the Geometric Principles of Nature, Cosmos and the Ageless Wisdom lie behind an imminent Grand Unification of the Sciences, Arts & Global Consciousness.Throughout the history of the world, a hidden undercurrent of Ageless Wisdom (arising through the Mystery Schools, initiation and other transformative experiences) has existed alongside the traditional body of academic education.The student will depart from this course with a solid understanding of the Geometric Principles underlying the current Renaissance in the Sciences, Arts & Consciousness, together with a meaningful selection of Geometric Drawings & 3-D Constructions that will help illustrate this revelatory experience. What we will cover in this in this LIVE Face-to-Face Workshop (but is not limited to) :1.	  Cracking the Code of Plato’s Secret Doctrine – and Uncovering the Underlying Principles.2.	  The resulting golden mean number system and its central role in the Sciences, Arts & Consciousness.3.	  The Sacred Geometric Principles of Nature – focusing on bio-mimicry, ecology & sustainability.4.	  The Human Body – Aesthetic Canons of Proportion and Energetic Transformation.5.	  Sacred Measure, Golden Mandalas & Transformative Experience amongst the Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Hebrew Kabbalists, Greeks, Aztecs, and Florentine Renaissance artists & philosophers.6.	  An enhanced group of drawings and 3-D geometric constructions, including Metatron’s Cube with the Flower of Life, Golden Chalice of Orion, Felt’s Mystic Kabbalistic Figure, the Golden Mandala, the 5 Platonic solids (including illustrative Archimedean & Catalan solids) and assemblage of a Golden Ruler.7.	  Resonance, Attunement and the Transformation of Consciousness. What it means to live in a Fractal Holographic Universe with Self-Similarity at each level, and the potential of the Whole Universe enfolded into each Part. In essence, we will “see” How the One becomes Many, and get a pretty good idea of How Each of the Many may return back unto the One.Scott Olsen, Ph.D. will focus on Sacred Geometric Principles related to:1.	The unveiling of Plato’s Secret Doctrine – fully revealing Plato’s Mystery of the One and Indefinite Dyad. Note: Pythagoras and Plato were both initiated into the Egyptian and Eleusinian Mysteries and were thus under the Sodalian oath of silence. Nevertheless, both maintained an oral doctrine or “agrapha dogmata,” their so-called Secret Doctrine.2.	The significance of numerous Biometric Anomalies – pointing again and again to the golden mean number system as the substructure of all reality, abductively leading to a Grand Unification of the Sciences, Arts and Consciousness.  3.	How this ubiquitous presence of the golden mean number system has emerged at the heart of quantum mechanics (including quark masses, chaos border, fine structure constant and entanglement), nanotechnology, crystallography, cryptography, genetics, DNA structure, biometric measurements of skulls, cardiac anatomy and physiology, phyllotaxis, weather turbulence, planetary orbits and sizes, black holes, dark energy, dark matter, and even cosmogenesis – the very origin and structure of the universe. 4.	And the realization that the golden mean number system lies at the heart of aesthetics, where form, function and performance coalesce in Beauty, Truth and the Good.The related drawings and philosophical insights:1.	The Golden Rectangle leading to the Golden Chalice of Orion – a single composite drawing showing how root two, root three, and the semi-elevation of the Great Pyramid arise naturally out of the Golden Section – the Primordial Scission.2.	George Henry Felt’s rediscovery of the Star of Perfection along with the Egyptian, Kabbalistic & Greek Canons of Proportion. Note: Felt’s lecture on this topic in H.P. Blavatsky’s apartment (here in New York city) was the catalyst for the founding of the Theosophical Society.3.	Discussion of how the hexagram (6), pentagram (5) and septagram (7) are involved in initiation and the transformation of consciousness.4.	A discussion (along with Harding) of the Mystery surrounding the 3 Means (Geometric, Harmonic and Arithmetic) and their special relation to the Series of Golden Powers.5.	A recognition of what we are actually doing: solving the greatest philosophical puzzle: “How does the One become the Many?” And further: “How do each of those Many return back to the One?” Recall Heraclitus: “The Way Up & the Way Down are One & the Same.”Melodi will focus on Sacred Geometry related to: 1.	The unveiling of Nature’s Genius by deep looking into her design processes using an art & science approach. This is to understand how she builds up synergistically from micro to macro, part to whole and vice-versa.2.	Meeting with Nature, our great mentor’s teachings of Life’s Principles from the fields of biomimicry, ecology and sustainability. 3.	Geometry of Space & Time within the perspective of the form and function core-relation.4.	Qi-Gong knowledge connected with our body and its movements in Traditional Chinese Wisdom. 5.	Visualization and experiencing our own unique self-expression.The related concepts, philosophical insights and drawings & constructions:1.	Free hand drawings analyzing nature’s shapes and forms.2.	Metatron’s Cube drawings and their relations with Sacred Geometry.3.	Part to whole relation as in natural building up processes with individual intuitions and teamwork experience. 4.	3D constructions of Platonic and some Archimedean and Catalan solids.5.	Golden Ruler construction along with experiencing nature’s Golden Section.Lance will focus on Sacred Geometry concepts and drawings related to:1.	The Golden Mandala geometric analysis of the Dendera Zodiac and The Aztec Calendar.2.	Solomon’s Temple, the Tabernacle of Moses & the Arc of the Covenant.3.	DaVinci’s Vitruvian Man and The Lost Golden Canon of Polyclitus.4.	Egyptian Canons of Proportion and the Ashmolean metrological figure.

All that's required is an open mind and a willingness to be compassionate and supportive. Plan for 60 minutes on Sunday, from 12:00-1:00 PM EASTERN.This workshop is for you if: You're naturally everyone else's biggest cheerleader, and you're ready to prioritize being your own.  You need to remember how to make time for yourself. And you've grown accustomed to being on auto-pilot as you tend to the needs of everyone around you.  You're looking for a process that will guide you into a sustainable journaling practice that celebrates you. You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals. ANYONE CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER, BUT BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE JOURNALING PRACTICE THAT'S FUN REQUIRES CONSISTENCY. Are you ready to explore what journaling that celebrates yourself could look and feel like for you? Sign up today, check your email for details, and arrive ready to go all in!

A wildly inventive, reality-bending trip, Lipstein challenges our notions of virtue with a brilliant tale of guilt, greed, and how far we’ll go to be good.

Whether you are an experienced teacher, or new to the teaching profession you will feel excited and motivated for your upcoming school year after participating in this highly immersive and collaborative workshop. Participants will engage in thought-provoking, pertinent experiments, and activities that you can utilize in your own classroom. We will spend time observing instruction from the point of view of a student (“student-mode”), and learn strategies to incorporate in their own classroom using the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework, Social Ecological Systems (SES), transdisciplinary thinking, and panarchy as tools to probe student preconceptions. Periodically, participants will switch to “teacher-mode”, to practice Socratic questioning techniques, analyze readings, and discuss the pedagogical rationale for all aspects of active learning and modeling in Environmental Science. We’ll also discuss strategies for accommodating district-specific curricular requirements, various student populations, laboratory resources, and the use of “Reflective Checklists” as a way of promoting student reflection throughout a unit.The Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science curriculum curriculum blends a humanities-based lens with scientific methods to create a transdisciplinary approach, to empower students to live more sustainable lives. Panarchy transcends the boundaries of scale and discipline. Most importantly, the panarchy model advocates a transition from a static understanding of nature to a dynamic idea that places an emphasis on multiple stable states, resilience, and cross-scale interactions that result in adaptive change. The adaptive cycle –  in its development, deployment, and representation – ties each of the units of the APES curriculum together. So if you’re a high school environmental science teacher wanting to learn some great activities to invigorate your teaching practices or a teacher wanting to learn some notable strategies to improve student discourse then this is the workshop for you!Cost: (Limited # of tickets!)Early Bird $275General Admission Teacher Price $350General Admission School Price $500STEMteachersNYC delivers professional development workshops for teachers, by teachers, about teaching, since 2011.

Through myth making and tool use, they facilitate small groups in building bridges from land to sea, imagining sustainable ecologies.With the aim to cultivate space for collective trust and shared dreaming, Tree+Oyster arrive with non verbal communication and play to shed anthropocentric perspective and facilitate opportunities for emergent ritual.Tree+Oyster merge archipelagic Indigenous mythologies from the Dominican Republic and the Philippines in order to stoke memory, resist erasure, and generate new mythologies. With curiosity to discover cross-cultural parallels in land-water relationship between Indigenous communities and their own personal decolonization research, T+O engage in immersive research deepening their relationship to land and community. From this foundation, they facilitate creative gatherings bridging inner and outer ecologies — a practice in tuning our personal, communal, and digital relationship to the landscape.Site-specific gatherings consist of co-creation exercises and games, sensorial ceremonies, body mapping, collective altar building, and musical forest jams. Seasonal elements, i.e. sand, soil, and vegetation, inform the location and structure of interactive installations. These onsite activations create a generative mediated space for communal storytelling. Rooted in the study of Indigenous histories, local-to-global community, and ecology, Tree+Oyster aim to build a cross-cultural campfire generating warmth, in empathetic pursuit of sustainability.Tree/ Tree.ceo is the performance art and design project of Ana Vásquez, in which she appropriates means of performance marketing to co-create regenerative loops and funnels that supplant cultural erasure. Informed by her practice as an Emergent Strategy facilitator, new media artist, and brand designer, her Dominican background serves as a starting point for stoking Pre-Columbian collective memory. She employs soft power to explore intersectional myth-making and tool-building for lush ecosystems.Jennae “Oyster” Santos is a music and performance artist and Babaylanic student born in the Bay Area (Ohlone territory) and based in Brooklyn (Lenapehoking territory), with ancestral roots across the Philippines archipelago. In infinite collaborative incarnations, she helms progressive art rock project gushes— songwriting and composition rooted in rhythmic guitar loops and ritualized theatre with a stylistic range encompassing chamber rock ensemble, experimental drone, movement cycle, sound sculpture, and more. Santos’ work is influenced by Indigenous Filipino psychology, Kali as a decolonized combat art, the feminist occult, plant medicine and ecology, BIPOC land revolution movements, genderqueer fluidity, and pleasure autonomy."

He is fascinated by the expressions of life in all beings and tries to capture them for others to see. What started as taking video of a sparrow here and a squirrel there soon started consuming most of his time on the weekends documenting moments of non-human life that mostly go unnoticed by the busy city dwellers. His current film “Seeds of the City” revolves around gardening in the cities, the stories of those who share a passion for growing for reasons that would soon surprise him. Venus is a software engineer by profession. Tobias Fox As Founder and Managing Director of the community-driven, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization Newark Science and Sustainability, Inc and founder and Facilitator of the Newark Community Food System, Tobias A. Fox have demonstrated collaborative leadership on a grassroots level for ten years. Aside from being a writer and having a decade of independent publishing experience, he is a professional organizer, urban farmer, photographer, and coordinator of an annual Sustainable Living Empowerment Conference. Fox also conducts various community events, presentations, and workshops on sustainable living practices and assisted numerous urban farmers and gardeners with the cultivation of their agricultural space. He has also assisted with the planting of nearly 100 trees in low-income communities with high environmental concerns. More recently, Fox has expanded his global outreach into the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Uganda.David Lee David Lee is an ink and watercolor artist who lives and works in New York City. His style is inspired by traditional East Asian watercolor painting, architectural drawings, and illustrations. Through a combination of linework and color, he seeks to honestly render the essence of the environments we inhabit, to give attention to all elements within them. His work also invites people to see how life and meaning carry on amidst the chaotic emergence of a new normal, e.g., climate change impacts, alternative visions. David has a background in architecture and urban planning and works as an environmental planner.Tammy HollowayMs. Tammy Holloway is a Newark, New Jersey native dedicated to advocating for social, political, and economic inclusive development. Finely centered in forward mobility policies that anchor culture, and inclusiveness and improve the quality of life for the greater good, Tammy has demonstrated tenacity to overcome obstacles while simultaneously creating opportunities for others.

Its mission is to restore oyster reefs to New York Harbor through public education initiatives in order to create a future in which New York Harbor is the center of a rich, diverse, and abundant estuary. Oysters have a remarkable ability to filter nitrogen pollution from water as they eat, earning them the nickname “ecosystem engineers” because we see biodiversity levels increase dramatically surrounding oyster reefs, and the belief is that restoring oysters and reefs will, over time, restore the local marine ecosystem’s natural mechanisms for maintaining itself, resulting in cleaner water and greater biodiversity.Testimonials""Montana was an excellent tour guide I learned a lot"" -Richard""I liked everything, interesting, educational and fun"" -Kathleen""Great all around activity."" -Ben""﻿Access to & information about a place in NYC that was something I didn't know much about"" -Adrienne""﻿Educational: How oysters can help clean environment.

Urbanization, population growth, and climate change have led to challenges with solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal, and has put stress on water resources. This year’s lab investigates the ways that designers, artists, creative technologists, policy makers, activists, and educators are working to deal with these impacts and what projects are being undertaken to mitigate these risks. The statistics outline a worsening situation.Globally the average person generates 1.6 lbs of waste per day and total waste will rise as the world’s population increases. Even as waste treatment methods have improved, a lot of waste ends up in dump sites and only “20 percent of waste is recycled each year” (Alves, 2023). Hazardous waste, which is especially harmful – coming from dyes, metals in batteries and electronics, and solvents – suffers from inadequate household awareness and lack of industry compliance. Clean water and water systems are taken for granted in many parts of society just as many rivers and lakes have “dried up” or have become “too polluted to use” — and it is expected that by 2025, “two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages.” (WWF, 2023).

Tackling these emissions is critical if we are to make Net Zero a reality, and while large corporates are setting Scope 3 targets and committing to decarbonizing their value chains, many businesses are still struggling to take action.Scope 3 emissions are by nature a collective challenge, and a complex one. Getting  answers and solutions to achieve Scope 3 emission reductions and credibly report on the impact achieved is an absolute priority, and it has been a key focus of the Value Change Initiative since 2017. Since then, we have focused on making Scope 3 operationable trough the implementation of Market Based Mechanisms. On September 20, join us for Climate Week’s premier Scope 3 event. Together with leading experts and companies, let’s explore and discuss solutions to accelerate action when traceability is imperfect, enable collaboration and partnerships, and make Net Zero value chains a reality in today’s Scope 3 landscape."
