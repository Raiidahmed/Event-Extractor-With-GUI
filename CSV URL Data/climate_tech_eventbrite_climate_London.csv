The space comprises an indoor room (also where toilets are located), large enclosed garden and within the garden is an open tent.Please note: we are now running one longer session.  The idea is that any ages are welcome for the whole time but suggesting the first 1.5hrs is for the younger ones and second 1.5hrs for the older children. The main reason for this is so we don’t have such a large age difference on the soft play / inflatable equipment at the same time. Here's what to expect at the space: INDOORS:S﻿ensory Den with sensory objects, materials and books.  GARDEN:Obstacle Course Inflatable with slide. Giant Connect 4. Make-Do-PlayMake-Do Play are coming back to The Together Space to run our art workshop!Make-Do Play CIC run child-led, non-judgemental community play sessions with loose parts - repurposed everyday objects which have multiple playful possibilities. Rooted in the Playwork Principles, children are free to explore the space, take risks, get as messy as they desire, build and destroy, and play in whichever ways they choose without unnecessary adult interference but alongside supportive playworkers.To find out more, visit their website: https://make-do-play.weebly.com/O﻿PEN TENT:S﻿oft Play and Ball PitActivities:2﻿:30 - 4:30: Blink Dance Theatre workshop.

The workshop ends with a visit from the visually arresting Starman; he offers his dazzling light to all but will it be enough to save the day?3﻿:30 - 4:30: Double Bass Dan. After the huge success of his previous performance at The Together Space, Dan is back! CaféWhilst your children are doing these activities, you can sip on a hot drink and munch a pastry from local café Haven Coffee who will be popping up. Pastries made by Today Bread.

Produced as part of Retrofit 23 and taking place on Wednesday evenings at the Building Centre, this series showcases research and ideas on the residential retrofit challenge. The panels feature guest speakers presenting a project or provocation, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. Join us for these thought-provoking sessions and meet and share with others involved in the retrofit puzzle. In this session on 19th July, panellists will explore community organisation and action and present case studies, before we open up a discussion with our audience.   Lily Green of Hubbub: “The Big Street Upgrade: how can community action break down barriers to retrofitting?”	 John Christophers of Retrofit Balsall Heath: “Community-led = Retrofit Reimagined?”  Hubbub is a charity which believes that to create positive environmental change at the scale and speed needed, we need to get everyone on board. That's why since 2014, they've been designing campaigns that inspire ways of living that are good for the environment. In partnership with OVO Energy Solutions and support from Glasgow City Council, Hubbub are running the Big Street Upgrade, a project supporting a community in Glasgow. Lily Green will talk about this process – to enable the community to make both individual and collective improvements to make their homes more energy efficient.  Retrofit Balsall Heath is a local community group, two years old - but building on local green initiatives going back more than 15 years.  This diverse inner-city area in Birmingham includes the UK’s first zero carbon retrofit, IFEES (the Islamic Foundation for Ecology & Environmental Sciences) founded in 1980s and Bahu Trust, accredited observers at UN climate and biodiversity summits.  John Christophers will talk about his work with this group, and ideas that neighbourhood scale retrofit can’t be top-down, it must be community led, collective street-by-street action.  Rafe Bertram Sustainability Facilitator at Enfield Council will chair this session. Rafe’s role at the London Borough of Enfield is Retrofit Asset Manager, Sustainability Lead of Meridian Water and Joint Interim Head of Climate Action and Sustainability across the council.

With both Europe and the world undergoing a major technological transformation, a new phenomena such as artificial intelligence are slowly making their way into all aspects of our lives, from communication to health, from culture to sustainability. What are the innovations and scientific discoveries shaping our future?The Innovations for a Sustainable Future exhibition seeks to create a dialogue between science, society, culture and art. Its main aim is to address current global issues and the inevitable role science and new technologies will play in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set up by the United Nations in 2015 as a blueprint for a better, more sustainable future for all. The 17 SDGs were adopted by all UN member states agreeing to work on, among other things, a plan to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve gender equality and avert climate threats by 2030.This interactive augmented reality exhibition was artistically rendered by the renowned Czech graphic designer Pavel Fuksa, drawing from the concept of the successful Czech Innovation Expo which travelled the world presenting Czech scientific discoveries and innovations. The new London exhibition highlights innovations and issues on a European level, reflecting the higher purpose of science with special emphasis on the means needed to implement the ambitious SGDs.How the Exhibition WorksVisitors will see seemingly static outdoor panels with abstract symbols on the walls. After downloading the exhibition app (available free for Android and iOS), they will see the space around them come to life on their devices, allowing them to explore in a fun and unique way a variety of scientific stories and fascinating information about technological innovations contributing to our sustainable future.

Climate Cafés offer something different from the usual gatherings of people with interests in climate change. They are facilitated – so you can be sure that there will be space for you to speak. They are not designed to recruit you to do anything or to put you under any pressure. The idea behind them is that talking about climate change is really important – but it is often made more difficult by our feelings of guilt that we are not doing enough, or frustration that others are not doing enough. So a space is provided in which we don’t talk about what we or others are doing or should be doing. We just talk about climate change and how it is making us think and feel.

Everyone is welcome, though we don’t advise young children attending. (18 years plus) There’s no charge. We are hoping to run this as a regular session – so please support this event if you are interested."

Energy security and net zero are two sides of the same coin. The energy transition and net zero are among the greatest opportunities facing this country and we are committed to ensuring that the UK takes advantage of its early mover status. Global action to mitigate climate change is essential to long term prosperity – the overall costs and risks of global warming to be equivalent to losing between 5% and 20% of global GDP each year.After decades of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s mission is to replace them with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy. In response to high household energy bills resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the government stepped in, paying around half of the average household’s energy bills over winter and around half of wholesale energy costs for some businesses. But the way to maintain lower cost energy for everyone is to move to cleaner and cheaper energy to protect us from volatile international energy markets, while underpinning our clean energy transition, so the UK becomes a net zero economy by 2050. It will also help us make sure Britain has among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe by 2035. The UK has already made huge progress in decarbonising its economy and decoupling emissions from economic growth. Thanks to the Climate Change Act (2008) and Environment Act (2021), we have a strong legal framework for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Between 1990 and 2021, we have cut our emissions by 48%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, whilst growing the economy by 65%. The UK was also the first G7 country to sign net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 into law. The UK’s strategy for net-zero is to lead the world in ending our contribution to climate change while turning this mission into the greatest opportunity for jobs and prosperity for our country since the industrial revolution.Removing dirty fossil fuels from the global economy will lead to the creation of vast new global industries from offshore wind to electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. By moving first and making the United Kingdom the birthplace of the Green Industrial Revolution we are building a defining competitive edge. The changes will have wider benefits for the public and businesses alike. We will all enjoy cleaner air, increased biodiversity and improved access to green spaces. We will see greater efficiency in the way we travel and heat our buildings, which will be better protected from more extreme weather events. We will also put consumers at the heart of this transition, helping them make their homes warmer, and more efficient, and ensure that they pay a fair, affordable price for their energy.In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero-emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. And everywhere you look, in every part of our United Kingdom, there will be jobs. Good jobs, green jobs, well-paid jobs, levelling up our country while squashing down our carbon emissions. That is the clean and prosperous future that awaits every one of us as the UK leads the world in the race to net zero. But we cannot tackle climate change alone. We will need to take a coordinated approach, working across local and national government, the devolved administrations, and with businesses and civil society organisations. And we will need to make it easier and fairer for individuals, businesses and households to decarbonise so that our whole society can work together to reduce emissions. Don’t miss this fantastic opportunity to attend the conference and hear from those leading on the net-zero agenda by highlighting key examples of case studies and projects from around the world using new innovations and technologies which can help accelerate the transition to a net-zero nation by 2050.Join us on the 15th of Novembner 2023 for the Net Zero Nations Projects Conference.Get Involved, We All Have A Part to Play…..Find Yours!"

We need to imagine it in some detail so as to be able to think about it clearly and constructively, and to explore some complex feelings and thoughts which may often be taboo and hard to talk about.With sturdy enough support structures in place, most people can sustain challenging feelings. They can engage with difficult truths whilst staying connected and grounded.A climate café aims to be such a structure - a container that is strong enough to allow the exploration of fear, anxiety, and other difficult emotions such as anger, helplessness, sadness, grief or depression. It can also be a place to find hope through connection with other people who share our concerns.The focus of discussion is participants’ feelings and thoughts about the climate and ecological crisis. There are no guest speakers and no talks, and it is an advice-free zone. Whilst the climate and ecological crisis is usually the main focus of the café we realise that other related preoccupations need a space to be explored. This can happen here too.The café is open to anyone aged 18 or over who is worried about the climate and ecological crisis.

We need to imagine it in some detail so as to be able to think about it clearly and constructively, and to explore some complex feelings and thoughts which may often be taboo and hard to talk about.With sturdy enough support structures in place, most people can sustain challenging feelings. They can engage with difficult truths whilst staying connected and grounded.A climate café aims to be such a structure - a container that is strong enough to allow the exploration of fear, anxiety, and other difficult emotions such as anger, helplessness, sadness, grief or depression. It can also be a place to find hope through connection with other people who share our concerns.The focus of discussion is participants’ feelings and thoughts about the climate and ecological crisis. There are no guest speakers and no talks, and it is an advice-free zone. Whilst the climate and ecological crisis is usually the main focus of the café we realise that other related preoccupations need a space to be explored. This can happen here too.Facilitated by trained hosts, members of the Climate Psychology Alliance."

The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.W﻿e also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.T﻿AN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen. We hope it will cement friendships and empower the large number of people who have been campaigning at a grassroots level over the past few years.If you would like to reclaim your entrance ticket and rail fare we do have a small amount to pay for bursaries. Information about this will be in your confirmation email.P﻿lenty of opportunities for networking and making friends"
