Since 1983, she has explored strategies in choreography, improvisation, and collaboration in experimental dance. In 2000, her work took a new turn to investigate the relationship between movement and environment. This ongoing research has led her into inquiries of cultural and scientific understandings of large-scale phenomena such as animal navigation and migration, geological formations such as aquifers, and re-functioned sites such as the abandoned Ridgewood Reservoir. These studies provide the means to unearth and inquire into choreographic and embodied ways of knowing and reimagining our relationship to the environments and spaces humans/all beings inhabit. Her projects BIRD BRAIN (2000-2005), iMAP/Ridgewood Reservoir (2007), and the Mahomet Aquifer Project (2008-2010), SIP (sustained immersive process)/watershed are investigations that have radically reframed the role dance plays in our cultural understandings of nature and wilderness. Her current work Live Dancing Archive proposes that choreography itself is an archival practice for environmental phenomena. N﻿TAFLF- No one turned away for lack of funds.

It is in our nature to tell stories and inform others of our life events. Storytelling is an intrinsic human characteristic. However, the way we communicate with others has changed drastically over time. Storytelling originated with visual stories, such as cave drawings, and then shifted to oral traditions, in which stories were passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. Technology has allowed humans to utilize all forms of storytelling through the years: visual stories in photographs, spoken stories in videos and recordings and written words on blogs and statuses.Throughout history, cultures have honored skilled storytellers and people have used stories to promote cooperation and influence social behaviors. Listening to stories also engages different parts of the brain than data does and engages our emotions. For this show the stories will focus on a theme:  GreenGreen is a color but it conjures up so many other images: Green with envy; Green as the color of money; Green in nature. Turning green when ill. Beng naive. Being green from a climate perspective, or showing your Irish pride. So come on out and see what Green means.  Come tell us your true story of Green. Any way you want to interpret the theme is fine with us.Or just listen and laugh. (Caveat: not all stories may be funny.) Rules: For a chance to tell your true story on the theme, ""Green,"" put your name in the hat.Stories must be true, about you (not someone else), and 5 minutes or less. No notes or reading allowed. We will have a timer to keep you on track. We usually have time for 8 to 10 storytellers.Suggested minimum is $10 per person worth of food or drink purchased at The Sound Room to support our venue sponsor, The Sound Room. Doors open at 5:30. Stories begin around 6:30. Seating is first-come, first serve. Order at the bar and be served at your table. We recommend you arrive early enough to pick your seats and get your beverages and food. There will be one intermission.The venue and stage are wheelchair-accessible..StorySlam Oakland is not responsible for the content of the open-mic stories. For this reason, younger children are not advised to come.StorySlam Oakland is Oakland's longest-running true storytelling show, started by Julie Soller in 2013.

Time Magazine has called her ""Africa's premier diva”, and named her one of the most influential people in the world for 2021; The BBC, Forbes Magazine, and The Guardian have all highlighted her importance to the people of the African continent. She is the recipient of the 2015 Crystal Award given by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the 2016 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award, and the 2018 German Sustainability Award. As a performer, her striking voice, stage presence and fluency in multiple cultures and languages have won respect from her peers and expanded her following across national borders. Kidjo has cross-pollinated the West African traditions of her childhood in Benin with elements of American R&B, funk and jazz, as well as influences from Europe and Latin America.Angelique also advocates on behalf of children as a UNICEF and OXFAM Ambassador. She created her own charitable foundation, Batonga, dedicated to support the education of young girls in Africa.JUPITER & OKWESSExplosive! Na Kozonga, the new album by Jupiter and his band Okwess is a blast of energy that bewitches the body and feeds the spirit. Since the beginning, the Rebel General and his fellow pyrotechnicians have been drawing the rhythms of the Congo out of obscurity to reveal their superpowers: the powers of rock and funk, ready for every kind of musical coupling and any kind of invitation! From Damon Albarn to Money Mark (Beastie Boys) via, on this new album, the samba of Rogê, the rap of Marcelo D2, the horns of New Orleans or the voice of the militant Chilean singer Ana Tijoux. Jupiter & Okwess have no fear of strange encounters, nor the craziest journeys. They’ve even managed to conquer Latin America, and are currently busy recreating the triangular trade, in sounds! No surprise from one who, on his first album, declared “Ich bin ein Congolese...The world is my land.” “We all have ancestors in Africa,” Jupiter reminds us, “and they also played music. And if Africa looks like a revolver, its trigger can be found...in the Congo!’ Ready, Steady, Go! Jupiter and his joyous pistoleros are giving us the go-ahead. A new world tour awaits them. It’s up to you to follow their incandescent star.Tickets are required for festival entry. Each attendee must have a ticket with a unique QR code for entry. This is a 1 ticket to 1 person policy.

Do you accept hazmat shipments? Are your employees certified to ship hazmat? If your answer to any of the above is “yes” then you need HAZMAT Transportation Training! Compliance Solutions is the nation's largest private provider of HAZMAT Training. Since 1995 we have helped companies across North America comply with DOT HAZMAT shipping regulation 49 CFR 172.704 and saved them thousands of dollars in the process!Who needs DOT HAZMAT Training?According to the DOT (The Department of Transportation) any company involved in the transport of hazardous materials by air, rail, ground or water must provide Hazmat transportation certification within 90 days of an employee starting work. Our DOT Hazmat Complete training is a one-day seminar designed to certify your employees in transporting hazardous materials. DOT regulations state: “Any person involved in offering a hazardous material for transportation must be properly trained” Upon completion, you will be able to:Demonstrate the correct methods used for the shipping, handling, and transporting of hazardous materialsIdentify the proper shipping methods for hazardous materials in air, water, and land.Recognize information needed on shipping papers for specific types of hazardous wastesUtilize proper labeling, marking, and placarding required for hazardous waste transportationDevelop information gathering techniques needed for required incident reporting and emergency notificationShow an understanding of the documentation for shipping papers and manifests.After your initial training, you will need to refresh your certification every 3 years or when the regulations ""substantially change"". This course qualifies as the “initial” training or “refresher” training. Be advised that should your certification lapse, you may not take part in any hazardous materials shipping functions “unsupervised” until your certification has been renewed.Our DOT Hazmat Course uses a unique ""10-step approach"" for shipping and handling hazardous materials properly.

Our programming is designed to encourage deep connections between attendees and help answer hard questions about textile-derived ocean pollution (i.e. microfiber pollution), climate change, textile waste, green chemistry, ocean-thoughtful material alternatives, and more.  This year's Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will be 5 hours - allowing time for educational programming, connecting deeply, and putting up the sails to enjoy some sailing! Participants will have the option to assist with sailing, or we welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. The longer sail will allow us to spend more time outside of the Golden Gate Bridge and see more of the San Francisco Bay! Educational activities include demonstrations of marine research techniques and participation in ""Educational Tastings"" - a series of short expert presentations that inspire conversation and discussion. Our tastings are facilitated by leaders at the intersection of Textile X Ocean with diverse backgrounds and a passion for knowledge-sharing.On board, you will learn how microfiber pollution is measured, what we know about the potential sources and pathways for fiber pollution in our region, discuss solutions at the forefront of our Textile X Ocean community, and upcoming ways to get involved in furthering research and solutions.Lisa Erdle, 5 Gyres Director of Science and Innovation joined the 2022 sail to help lead a demonstration on techniques to monitor microfiber pollution in water bodies. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyTARGET ATTENDEES:Target participants include a cross-sector group of textile industry experts, textile company representatives, scientists, policy makers, representatives from universities and environmental groups, students, young professionals, and other interested stakeholders. Please feel free to share this invitation with your colleagues or other interested parties that may like to join.A range of stakeholders from industry, brands, research entities, and environmental non-profits joined the 2022 sail with many new partnerships and relationships formed. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyABOUT THE ORGANIZERSTogether, Krystle Moody Wood and Carolynn Box have established themselves as some of the world's leading experts in microfiber pollution- an issue easily recognized at the intersection of oceans and textiles. With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyCarlie Herring, a research scientist at NOAA Marine Debris Program and co-author of the SOS 2.0 Report on Microfiber Pollution, is providing guests with an overview of the upcoming congressional report to spark discussion with attendees about federal action and policy.

Not only do we have to improve vehicle technology, but also we have to change entrenched economic interests, cultural norms, and people’s habits. Yet Americans are driving more and more in bigger and bigger vehicles, which only will get heavier as they get electrified.“It’s time to right-size our mobility choices,” says Steve Price, an urban design consultant and advocate for safe, convenient alternatives to personal automobiles. “We don't all have to get on bicycles, and maybe we don't even have to give up driving cars. But what should be the future of transportation in our region?”Steve will delve into this challenging question in an illustrated talk on Wednesday, July 5, at 7 p.m. He also will share some innovative options for “personal mobility.”Tickets for this program, available on Eventbrite, are $5 for club members and $10 for non-members. Please register early so we can be sure to accommodate everyone comfortably and safely. Masks are strongly encouraged.Steve founded Urban Advantage, a consulting firm that helps communities become “more in tune with nature and human needs.” To that end, Steve creates highly realistic photo simulations that enable people to visualize how their neighborhoods could be more walkable and more accommodating to alternatives to cars.  He has produced more than 600 simulations for communities across North America. His clients have included cities, urban designers, developers, transportation agencies, environmental groups, foundations, universities, and neighborhood groups. His images  have appeared in many publications, including the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the San Jose Mercury, and Sierra Magazine. He also wrote Imagining a Walkable America, a free, online book that imagines a low-carbon future for America’s towns and cities. Steve majored in sociology, but he hoped to become an artist, doing painting, drawing, and printmaking. However, he also wanted to use visual communication to achieve positive social change. Over the years, he worked as a freelance technical illustrator for high-tech companies, like Apple Computer, NeXT, Logitech, and Hewlett Packard. In the mid-1990s, he finally found a way to combine his artistic talents with his computer and communication skills to help improve the design of towns and cities.Steve is sure to inspire you to think about your transportation choices. You may be surprised by how, in the not-so-distant future, you may be able to get around without getting into your own car."

Today, companies are asked not just to innovate but to innovate sustainably.  To remain competitive, companies must accommodate a business landscape that embraces circularity and demands that companies operate in an eco-friendly, sustainable fashion. 

The Americas Conference, to be held at the INSEAD San Francisco Hub For Business Innovation, provides an exceptional platform to rethink and discuss, with senior business and government leaders, INSEAD faculty, and alumni, how companies can integrate environmental, social, and financial factors into their decision-making as well as generate new business ideas and organizational models.

On Nov 10th, we will announce the winners of Karel Cool and Ataly Atasu’s INSEAD’s Business Sustainability Awards. We are honored to have Andreas Jacobs, Chairman of INSEAD’s Board of Directors, join us for an awards ceremony and celebrations.

Sashiko is so much more than a stitching method or a sustainability practice. With a little care and intention, once worn out objects can transform into something beautiful and meaningful - all while sharing your story. Bring your own cotton or denim garment to mend or practice on our provided samples!You Will Learn How To:Work with a sashiko needle and threadLoad the needle with fabric by using the unshin stitching methodCreate Sashiko patternsMend your clothesRepurpose fabric scraps into something useful & beautifulA Brief History of SashikoMy mother used to often say, “Necessity is the mother of invention” and that is what comes to mind when I think of Sashiko’s humble origins. Sashiko was born out of necessity within the poor and working class communities of Japan to keep warm and make clothes last well beyond their initial life. The thick, cotton thread used for Sashiko helped to create a stronger, more practical garment that could be passed down for generations. While the documented origins of Sashiko date back to the Edo period (1603-1867) in Japan, there is evidence of identical patterns as early as the 6th century found in the attire of ancient Buddhist monks. It wasn’t until many years later that people began to also use the sashiko method as a means of expression by stitching more decorative and symbolic patterns onto their textiles. What is Sashiko?Sashiko is a form of folk art that translates to “little stabs”, which works well in describing the distinctive running stitch it relies on known in Japan as unshin. This stitch is made by loading the fabric in a back-and-forth motion onto the needle for several stitches at once before pulling it through and smoothing it out. This technique maximizes the length of your needle and results in an evenly-spaced, straight line of stitches. Focus on the process, not the outcome.Sashiko embraces the idea of the Japanese term, Wabi Sabi, that sees the beauty in the imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. Over time you will gain a rhythm that will create better results, but in order to achieve that flow state, you must first let go. This form of stitching can become a meditative state, allowing your mind to wander and bring happiness with each stitch. Like my mentor, Youngmin Lee says “Your stitches tell a story.” About the ArtistMariah was born and raised in Maine, where she first discovered her love of textiles. Starting at a young age, she collected scraps of fabric from hand-me-down clothing, antique linens, and her mother’s tattered scarf that lay hidden in a box of memories. While collecting these scraps, she didn’t have a plan, she just couldn’t bear to get rid of them. Each piece had its own sentiment and a story she knew she would one day share. A new life for these scraps came to fruition when she discovered a unique form of Korean textile art known as Bojagi. Mariah immediately fell in love with the symbolism inherent to the practice and the peace of mind each stitch brought her. It also resonated with her as a means of connecting to her Korean heritage and practicing sustainability.

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series.
