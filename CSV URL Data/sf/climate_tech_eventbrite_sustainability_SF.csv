Our programming is designed to encourage deep connections between attendees and help answer hard questions about textile-derived ocean pollution (i.e. microfiber pollution), climate change, textile waste, green chemistry, ocean-thoughtful material alternatives, and more.  This year's Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will be 5 hours - allowing time for educational programming, connecting deeply, and putting up the sails to enjoy some sailing! Participants will have the option to assist with sailing, or we welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. The longer sail will allow us to spend more time outside of the Golden Gate Bridge and see more of the San Francisco Bay! Educational activities include demonstrations of marine research techniques and participation in ""Educational Tastings"" - a series of short expert presentations that inspire conversation and discussion. Our tastings are facilitated by leaders at the intersection of Textile X Ocean with diverse backgrounds and a passion for knowledge-sharing.On board, you will learn how microfiber pollution is measured, what we know about the potential sources and pathways for fiber pollution in our region, discuss solutions at the forefront of our Textile X Ocean community, and upcoming ways to get involved in furthering research and solutions.Lisa Erdle, 5 Gyres Director of Science and Innovation joined the 2022 sail to help lead a demonstration on techniques to monitor microfiber pollution in water bodies.

With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world.

Chances are good that brown-shingled Arts and Crafts homes quickly come to mind. But modern houses built from the 1940s through the 1970s — and, indeed, still today — make a sizable contribution to some of the most beautiful and, arguably, most mysterious neighborhoods anywhere.
On Wednesday, August 2, at 7 p.m., architecture enthusiast and journalist Dave Weinstein will take us on a photo tour of some of these distinctive homes in Berkeley and beyond, discuss why modernism came late to the Bay Area, and explain why — and with whom — it proved so popular. We’ll also learn how this style, which looks so different from Arts and Crafts buildings, actually is deeply indebted to the Craftsman ethos.
Tickets for this program are $5 for club members and $10 for non-members. Please register early so we can be sure to accommodate everyone comfortably and safely. Masks are strongly encouraged.
For years, Dave has written about Bay Area architecture for the San Francisco Chronicle. His popular books include Signature Architects of the Bay Area, Berkeley Rocks, and It Came from Berkeley: How Berkeley Changed the World. For the past twenty years, his well-researched articles have appeared in CA-Modern magazine, which focuses on the mid-century modern tract homes that the famed developer Joseph Eichler built in the Bay Area, as well as on other topics related to modern design.
Dave also has worked to publicize and preserve the historic and natural landscapes of El Cerrito, where he lives. He is president of the El Cerrito Historical Society and El Cerrito Trail Trekkers. He was instrumental in saving and restoring the Cerrito Theater (now the Rialto Cinemas Cerrito) and in protecting the Madera Open Space by having it added to the city’s Hillside Natural Area.
Dave grew up on Long Island and studied art history at Columbia University and journalism at UC-Berkeley."

Not only do we have to improve vehicle technology, but also we have to change entrenched economic interests, cultural norms, and people’s habits. Yet Americans are driving more and more in bigger and bigger vehicles, which only will get heavier as they get electrified.“It’s time to right-size our mobility choices,” says Steve Price, an urban design consultant and advocate for safe, convenient alternatives to personal automobiles. “We don't all have to get on bicycles, and maybe we don't even have to give up driving cars. But what should be the future of transportation in our region?”Steve will delve into this challenging question in an illustrated talk on Wednesday, July 5, at 7 p.m. He also will share some innovative options for “personal mobility.”Tickets for this program, available on Eventbrite, are $5 for club members and $10 for non-members. Please register early so we can be sure to accommodate everyone comfortably and safely. Masks are strongly encouraged.Steve founded Urban Advantage, a consulting firm that helps communities become “more in tune with nature and human needs.” To that end, Steve creates highly realistic photo simulations that enable people to visualize how their neighborhoods could be more walkable and more accommodating to alternatives to cars.  He has produced more than 600 simulations for communities across North America. His clients have included cities, urban designers, developers, transportation agencies, environmental groups, foundations, universities, and neighborhood groups. His images  have appeared in many publications, including the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the San Jose Mercury, and Sierra Magazine. He also wrote Imagining a Walkable America, a free, online book that imagines a low-carbon future for America’s towns and cities. Steve majored in sociology, but he hoped to become an artist, doing painting, drawing, and printmaking. However, he also wanted to use visual communication to achieve positive social change. Over the years, he worked as a freelance technical illustrator for high-tech companies, like Apple Computer, NeXT, Logitech, and Hewlett Packard. In the mid-1990s, he finally found a way to combine his artistic talents with his computer and communication skills to help improve the design of towns and cities.Steve is sure to inspire you to think about your transportation choices. You may be surprised by how, in the not-so-distant future, you may be able to get around without getting into your own car."

This new, interactive, community story-sharing project provides a unique opportunity for connecting through beverages that tell a story. Audience members are invited to participate in a guided creative writing exercise: Share a story from your life in the form of a beverage or cocktail recipe. The story can be from any time period, moment, or memory, encouraging the audience to explore: What were you drinking at a certain time of your life, and how does this drink represent that time, the challenges you face, and overcoming these issues? How does this beverage relate to personal or family history and how can this be expressed in the ingredients, the type of glass or cup, the name of the drink or the way it is made? How do you relate to the concept of diaspora? The event encourages engagement with the museum not as a static repository but, “archive as engagement” to facilitate people sharing personal stories of mixing cultures, races, genders, political perspectives, metaphysics, locations, geographies, etc. Beverages made from the recipes of the featured drag performers will be available for purchase at the event.  Audience members can choose to contribute their recipe to this project, which will eventually be published at CHSA as a community exhibit.

Time Magazine has called her ""Africa's premier diva”, and named her one of the most influential people in the world for 2021; The BBC, Forbes Magazine, and The Guardian have all highlighted her importance to the people of the African continent. She is the recipient of the 2015 Crystal Award given by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the 2016 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award, and the 2018 German Sustainability Award. As a performer, her striking voice, stage presence and fluency in multiple cultures and languages have won respect from her peers and expanded her following across national borders.

Na Kozonga, the new album by Jupiter and his band Okwess is a blast of energy that bewitches the body and feeds the spirit. Since the beginning, the Rebel General and his fellow pyrotechnicians have been drawing the rhythms of the Congo out of obscurity to reveal their superpowers: the powers of rock and funk, ready for every kind of musical coupling and any kind of invitation! From Damon Albarn to Money Mark (Beastie Boys) via, on this new album, the samba of Rogê, the rap of Marcelo D2, the horns of New Orleans or the voice of the militant Chilean singer Ana Tijoux. Jupiter & Okwess have no fear of strange encounters, nor the craziest journeys. They’ve even managed to conquer Latin America, and are currently busy recreating the triangular trade, in sounds! No surprise from one who, on his first album, declared “Ich bin ein Congolese...The world is my land.” “We all have ancestors in Africa,” Jupiter reminds us, “and they also played music. And if Africa looks like a revolver, its trigger can be found...in the Congo!’ Ready, Steady, Go! Jupiter and his joyous pistoleros are giving us the go-ahead. A new world tour awaits them.

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series. COVID-19 information: Please cancel your shift and do not come to GFE if you develop COVID19 symptoms on or before the day of your workshop (fever, chills, repeated shaking / shivering, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, feeling unusually weak or fatigued, new loss of taste or smell, muscle pain, headache, runny or congested nose, or diarrhea)GFE will continue to monitor the COVID19 situation in San Francisco and make any necessary changes to the workshop based on current information.No walk-up registration permitted for this course. Full garden workshop scheduleWhat to bring to the workshopDirections to the gardenMore about Ellyn and our other gardening Instructors"

Generating over half of the state’s greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state’s transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA’s Climate Roadmap tackles the city’s ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city’s eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation. The session will include a moderated discussion and Q&A to engage with the audience.Program ParticipantsModerators: 	Taylor McAdam, Senior Transportation Planner, Fehr & Peers Panelists: 	 Tim Doherty, Policy and Long-Range Planning Team Lead - San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency  (SFMTA)Matt  Goyne, Principal - Fehr & Peers Michael Cox,  Principal Sustainability Analyst - San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)When:	Wednesday August 9th, 5:30 -7:30pmWhere:	Port of San Francisco, Pier 1 The Embarcadero, Bayside Room, San Francisco, CA, 94105Cost:		$60 WTS Members / $80 Non-Members / $10 Students or UnemployedFood:		Buffet style dinner & drinks will be providedRSVP:	Please RSVP by August 4 via Eventbrite Here﻿For questions, please email us at ProgramsWTSSanFrancisco@gmail.comEmpowering Women, Transforming Transportation.
