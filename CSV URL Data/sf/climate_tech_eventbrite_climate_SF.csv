Described by Relix Magazine as an artist with “a loyal, cross-generational audience that hugs the hippie, hipster, coffee shop and society crowds,” Leslie’s timeless musicality and evocative songwriting indeed cuts a wide swath. All Music writes that Leslie evokes “1970s songwriter influences in the vein of Carole King and Carly Simon,” while The Aquarian declares she is “the closest thing one can get to a truly honest musical experience.”  Leslie Mendelson’s previous work, including 2009 Grammy-nominated debut album ‘Swan Feathers’ and 2017 album, ‘Love & Murder’ dealt with matters of the heart. When it came time to compose the songs that comprise ‘If You Can’t Say Anything Nice…,’ however, she and her longtime writing partner Steve McEwan set out to examine the anxiety stemming from the current socio-political climate with songs like ""Medication,"" ""I Need Something To Care About"" and ""Would You Give Up Your Gun.” It’s fitting extension of a more socially conscious outlook offered on “A Human Touch”—Leslie’s duet with Jackson Browne for the documentary film, ‘5B,’ released in 2019.  If Leslie Mendelson’s only collaboration with a legendary musician was Jackson Browne, it would be a worthy point to celebrate. What’s truly telling is that Leslie has also drawn the attention of The Grateful Dead’s Bob Weir who recorded a duet with her on Roy Orbison's standard, “Blue Bayou,” while no less than classic rock royalty The Who invited her to open two shows at Madison Square Garden last year. She was set to open three more dates for the band in 2020 that were unfortunately postponed due to the pandemic. With some of rock music’s most legitimate voices seeking Leslie out, it leaves no doubt the rarefied air she inhabits as an artist.—D﻿oors: 6:00pmS﻿how: 7:00pm"

We especially need help removing eucalyptus sprouts from around the creek. Lunch will be served to volunteers between sessions. Spend time outdoors, meet new people, learn about invasive plants and creek habitat, and help restore the ancestral land of the Quiroste Tribe (represented by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band and Land Trust).Due to the rough terrain, this event is best suited for participants age 16 years and older.When you arrive at Cascade Ranch, meet Pie Ranch and AMLT staff in the parking area next to the first white barn or, if late, follow on foot the event signs from the parking lot to the area of the creek we will be working on. Previous experience is not necessary. We will teach you how to identify the target species and how to remove and process them.Be aware that the areas in which we will be working may contain poison oak, blackberries and other prickly plants like thistle and stinging nettle.

Indeed, healthy riparian ecosystems promote ecological and climate resilience both within and beyond riparian zones, lead to the accrual and sequestration of carbon and nitrogen in soil, absorb heat and buffer organisms against extreme temperatures. Cascade Ranch is within an area of high biological richness and surrounded by California protected areas. About 1.2 miles of Cascade Creek fall within the boundaries of the property, which is currently managed by the non-profit Pie Ranch. Cascade Creek represents an important habitat connectivity area for a wide array of plants and animals and a potential traditional food source for people. Unfortunately, the riparian zone has been highly affected by the spreading of invasive plant species, which are causing loss of biodiversity and related ecosystem services and products. The 2020 CZU complex fire has further contributed to the increase in number, variety and spread of invasive species along Cascade Creek.Your hard work and participation will help shape the future of this land! Thank you."

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eydis-evensen-tickets-607844538377?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/noise-pop-presents-27658561079,"“Classical music gamechanger” The Line Of Best Fit“Few artists are so effortlessly able to twist your heartstrings into a contortion of joy, sorrow and despair like Eydís Evensen” Wonderland Magazine​Some time ago, Eydís Evensen wrote a poem. This poem became the basis of a two-part choir composition, describing “a beautiful light that froze,” before concluding with a glimmer of hard-fought hope. “ljósið fagra lifir enn ljósið fagra lifir enn,” echoing voices on the second part of that composition insist – translating in English to “the beautiful light still survives.” The words were a reminder, to herself and to the world, that no matter the darkness around you, there’ll come a point when the pain will begin to thaw, so it’s always worth holding on. “It represents there always being something beautiful at the end of even the most terrible experience,” the Blönduós-born model-turned-piano sensation insists, “no matter how terrible the ordeal.” These words ripple through every note and melody of her astonishing second album, titled – what else? – The Light. It’s a record inspired by the resilience in all of us, she says – our ability to stand firm in the face of personal and collective catastrophe.The 29-year-old – who also sings on the album, for the first time – confronted her own hardships and sorrows in order to create The Light. Some were born from the crises we all endured together: the Covid-19 pandemic; her horror at Russia’s war on Ukraine; her dread that the glaciers and natural wonders of her native Iceland that inspired her to write music in the first place will soon be devastated by the impact of climate change. There were also personal ordeals – ghosts from her past to be exorcised, demons in her closet that pushed her to challenging brinks. As the toll of these situations weighed on her, Evensen did what she always did: she sat at her piano, stretched her fingers and began to play. “It’s always been like that,” smiles the artist. “I remember [as a child] walking to the piano and being able to let something out by playing the keys. It became a therapist and a best friend to me – I always felt better after I played.”Throughout her early life, Evensen never strayed far from that best friend. She played it every day growing up in the 800-person town of Blönduós, whenever her parents weren’t playing Led Zeppelin and Tchaikovsky on the family record player that is. When the composer later fell into a career as an international model, travelling the world, she sought out a piano wherever she was (even once knocking on a door in London when she heard the sound of piano from an open window, so she could ask to play). In 2021, she released her debut album Bylur and immediately found herself touted as a vital new voice in contemporary classical music. Millions of streams on Spotify were followed by millions more on YouTube, where a KEXP live session went viral (one of the top comments on the video states: “this music makes you forget about time” – not an inaccurate assessment).When her equally well-received 2022 EP Frost further cemented her reputation as a glimmering new talent, Evensen should have been on top of the world. Instead, there were historic traumas still to be worked through. It was only after heading back home to Blönduós, and a subsequent breakthrough in her recovery from a devastating childhood ordeal, that the creative floodgates opened for her and The Light really began to take shape. “For two days, I composed and cried. I put my phone on record and just played whatever I could play,” she recalls. “In those recordings I moved through all of these emotions.”Emotion is ever-present on The Light, a record that shows not just Evensen’s personal growth but a musical expanding of wings, too. Opener Anna’s Theme is a competitive float that pulls you into a dream-like state, teetered tonally between heartache and hope. Choral composition The Light II underlines Evensen’s new-found boldness away from piano (not to mention her eventual aspirations to move into film scoring: “that’s definitely a dream of mine”). Finally, horns and strings entwine on the soaring Tephra Horizon before Full Circle begins to pull the album’s narrative back towards brightness – back towards that beautiful light that still survives. Perhaps most personal to the 29-year-old is the track Near Ending. “I composed that piece following my experience in Blönduós,” Evensen reveals. “I hadn’t played it since I composed it and I didn’t want to practise or demo it before recording it for the album. I wanted it to be completely raw. What’s on the album is the only take I did, in complete free-flow.”Why share all this? “I thought it’s important to be honest about these emotions so that maybe it can help people,” says the composer. “It’s been a really hard last couple of years for everyone. In that time, I’ve had a lot of messages about how my music has helped them with personal experiences, losing relatives and going through illnesses. Those messages have been such a gift.” The Light is Evensen’s gift in return – an astonishingly powerful call-to-arms to carry on, because after the darkness comes dawn. It always has, and it always will."

Clare was five foot two and too young to officially join the service—she left her birthdate blank on her paperwork, hoping no one would notice. And she didn’t look like her peers, who sported an Adam’s apple and a mustache. But her brother was a firefighter and loved it, so she thought she’d try it out, too. Very soon, she knew she’d found her calling.Burnt: A Memoir of Fighting Fire  is Clare’s inspiring, richly detailed, and open-hearted account of an extraordinary life in fire. It chronicles the transformation of a young adult determined to prove her mettle into a scarred and sensitive veteran, grappling with the weight of her duties as Chief of Fire Prevention—one of the highest-ranking women in Cal Fire history—while record-setting fires engulf her home state. Mentors and managing, funerals and scandal, pickup basketball, car crashes, and always fire—no one has written about this world, from this perspective, like Clare Frank. She masterfully mixes irreverence and awe, taking readers inside station houses, on daily calls, and along on wildfire campaigns where antics and dark humor balance terrifying risk, trauma, and a sense of almost holy responsibility. Burnt is an unforgettable memoir from an American original.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Clare Frank started firefighting in California at 17 and was promoted up the ranks, becoming the state’s first and only female Chief of Fire Protection. Along the way, she earned a BS in fire administration, an MFA in creative writing, and a JD. She has lectured at colleges, universities, and state and national fire conferences, and lives near Lake Tahoe with her husband and two dogs. This is her first book.PRAISE FOR BURNT:“A vigorous and quite timely memoir . . . Throughout the book, Frank is energetic and inspirational, especially to women considering work in the field.” —Kirkus Reviews“Good memoirs can introduce intriguing individuals and provide access to rarefied pursuits. Author Frank manages both. . . The action scenes are compelling; there are hardwon victories and excruciating losses, and Frank emerges as a relatable and thoroughly human hero.”			   —Booklist“In this evocative account of life in the firehouse, Clare Frank portrays the risks firefighters face and the stakes that are now higher than they’ve ever been. She does so with grit and a healthy sense of humor. A must-read.” —Erin Brockovich“Ominous orange skies and smoke-choked cities: The wildfire crisis is here. Burnt takes you inside. From dirt firefighter to leading thousands, Clare Frank offers a real, humorous, one-of-a-kind front-row seat to wildfires and those who fight them.” —Caroline Godkin, Executive Director of the Climate and Wildfire Institute"

San Francisco Bay, CA is no exception. In fact, one of the highest-ranking apex predators, the broadnose sevengill shark, uses this bay as a place to pup their young. Sevengill sharks are found worldwide but the population along our coastline is the only population where we can consistently find juvenile sevengills in a pupping and nursery ground year-round! That opens a very unique opportunity to study these sharks at the beginning of their lives. So, why is a pupping and nursery ground important, and what are the conservation needs around this unique shark? Join us to find out! Meghan Holst is a third-year PhD student at UC Davis in the Graduate Group of Ecology. Meghan has completed a MSc in behavior and physiology of octopuses with an emphasis on how these correlate with welfare. Now she is pursuing a PhD in ecology studying the broadnose sevengill shark in San Francisco Bay. Meghan is equally passionate about conservation science as she is social justice and science communication work. In 2021, Meghan co-founded the 501(c)3 non-profit, Minorities In Aquarium & Zoo Science (MIAZS), and now maintains an executive directorship pursuing the mission to advance aquarium and zoo science by diversifying the professionals and their perspectives within it. Additionally, Meghan co-hosts a science podcast, Sharkpedia, where the primary authors of elasmobranch research are interviewed to communicate their science and strategies to the general public. Meghan intends to continue conducting science, communicating science in fun and interactive ways, and actively working to make the science fields more diverse and inclusive.Super Slime Me or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Live on Algae by Elliot RothAlgae enthusiasts and plankton party animals, welcome to the wacky world of green gastronomy! Over the past few weeks, our speaker has been on a wild, strange and sometimes hilarious adventure through the uncharted territory of munching on nothing but algae. He’s been surviving on some slime sublime as a means of investigating the potential of our tiny green friends to meet the challenges of everything from the impending climate catastrophe to life in space. Get ready to dive into weird self-experimentation, the carbon impact of food, and how you too might one day be eating algae on a daily basis.Elliot Roth is the founder of Spira, a company that uses genetically engineered algae grown by a global network of farming partners to make designer materials, starting with natural colors. He is a synthetic biologist with years of experience in product design and storytelling, and previously started 7 companies and 2 nonprofits. In his spare time he plays music, and participates in space analog missions while residing in San Francisco a few blocks from Dolores Park.DNA Data Storage: Using three billion year-old technology to solve a modern dilemma by Brian BramlettThe generation of digital information has outpaced the growth of storage capacity from early on, and the gap continues to grow exponentially. Meanwhile, no modern technology can store and retrieve data on timescales of more than a couple decades. Nature has evolved its own data storage medium—DNA—could that be the solution? Let’s talk about it!Brian Bramlett is a Technology Strategist, bringing teams and technologies together to build world-changing platforms. For over 35 years he has worked across a diversity of fields, from Smart Toys to Wearables, and most recently, synergies between semiconductors/computing and synthetic biology.We will also be joined by our partners in nerd-dom: the SF Public Library!

Her extensive achievements as a performer, author, recording and visual artist is acknowledged worldwide.Released in 1975, Smith’s first recording, Horses, was inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2010 by the National Recording Preservation Board. Her subsequent albums include Radio Ethiopia, Easter, which included Because the Night, cowritten with Bruce Springsteen, Wave, Dream of Life, which included People Have the Power cowritten with her late husband Fred Sonic Smith, Gone Again, Peace and Noise, Gung Ho, Trampin’, Land, Twelve, Banga, and Outside Society. She is a four-time Grammy® nominee and a Golden Globe nominee for the song “Mercy Is” cowritten with Lenny Kay for the film Noah. Steven Sebring’s 2008 documentary, Patti Smith: Dream of Life, received an Emmy nomination.Patti Smith was awarded the prestigious 2010 National Book Award for her bestselling memoir, Just Kids, chronicling her deep friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and the evolution of their work. Her books include Witt, Babel, Woolgathering, The Coral Sea, Auguries of Innocence, Collected Lyrics, M Train, Devotion and Year of the Monkey. A Book of Days, featuring 365 images and reflections will be published in November 2022.Smith holds the honor of “Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres” from the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She was honored by ASCAP with the Founders Award in 2010, representing lifetime achievement, and was the recipient of Sweden’s 2011 Polar Award, an international acknowledgement for significant achievements in music. In 2013, Smith received the Katharine Hepburn Medal from Bryn Mawr College, recognizing women whose contributions embody the drive and work ethic of the celebrated actress. In 2014, Barnard College Board of Trustees presented Patti Smith with their Medal of Distinction. In 2016, she was awarded the Burke Medal for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Trinity College, Dublin. Smith’s photographs, drawings, and installations have been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide. Coupled with her photography exhibit Higher Learning, Smith received the Laurea Magistrate causa  from Parma, Italy and an honorary doctorate in Euro-American Literature from Padova University. She was awarded The Badge of the Austrian Decoration of Science and Art in 2019.2020 Smith received the literary service prize from PEN America and the Wall Street Journal acknowledged her as a Literature Innovator and in May 2022 received the Doctor of Humane Letters from Columbia University as well as receiving the distinction of being named an Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honor by decree of the  President of the French Republic.Her renowned band includes guitarist and author Lenny Kaye, who she has collaborated with since 1971, drummer Jay Dee Daugherty since 1975, Tony Shanahan on bass and keyboards, since 1996, and her son, guitarist Jackson Smith, for over a decade. BOB MOULDBob Mould began his career as one of the angry upstarts of the hardcore punk scene, and over several decades he's matured into one of the elder statesmen of alternative rock without giving up his integrity, his intelligence, or the fierce passion of his best music. In the early '80s, Mould emerged as one of the founding members of Hüsker Dü, a Minneapolis-based punk band who blended furiously fast tempos with melodic pop structures on influential, groundbreaking albums like 1984's Zen Arcade and 1985's New Day Rising. After the breakup of Hüsker Dü, Mould launched a solo career with 1989's introspective, largely acoustic Workbook, but soon returned to a hard, angry sound on 1990's Black Sheets of Rain. In 1992, Mould formed another band, Sugar, who picked up where the pop-oriented sound of Hüsker Dü left off on albums like 1992's Copper Blue and 1994's File Under: Easy Listening. After Sugar split up in 1995, Mould returned to solo work, dividing his time between guitar-oriented efforts like 1998's The Last Dog and Pony Show and projects like 2002's Modulate that reflected his growing interest in electronic music. Mould walked a middle ground between the two styles on 2008's District Line, but with 2012's Silver Age, he recommitted himself to fluid but aggressive rock.

From the very first forms of mark-making to the caves of Lascaux to the works of Pablo Amaringo and Alex Grey, humanity has sought to understand our internal landscapes through visual expression. Alligator Lizards in the Air: Healing and Integration through Creative Expression, is a once a month chance to bring these experiences to life through two dimensional mark making.Art mediums from paint to colored pencils, crayons to markers, will be available for everyone to use along with paper and canvas. Krisztina Lazar will be your visionary guide in creativity and will help you realize your experience before your eyes. No art background needed for this class. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to explore. Krisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today’s cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California."

When the Phoenicians arrived before the Romans in 7th Century BC, they coined the term 'Enotria' or 'land of the vine' for its incredible diversity from region to region, often growing in such abundance traveller would pick and eat along the road! Today, the average consumer is inundated with a huge range of Italian wines, often resulkting in a dizzying 
experience at the shop or restaurant.In this tasting, sommelier Paul Robinson will introduce participants to 7 rising stars in the vast world of Italian grapes today. Cagnulari from Sardegna, Magliocco from Calabria and Nascetta from Piemonte are just a few we will be tasting and discussing in this class. Paul will cover each grapes history, characteristics and local food pairings. SERIES DESCRIPTION: 'Through the Glass' are one-of-a-kind wine experiences where history, cuisine and the culture of winemaking are presented together to provide an immersive educational experience. In contrast with classes found at culinary schools, restaurants and wineries, this program reflects a single sommelier working experience with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and American wines.

Tastings run between 90-120 minutes in length. Participants will receive a collateral booklet to follow along and make notes. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Classes are designed for all levels of wine experience/education, from newbies to aficionados.

A large family style farm to table dinner is included in the ticket price, prepared by a professional chef.  Conversations at these dinners are off the record and vulnerability and risk-taking in our dialogues are strongly encouraged.  This series aspires to weave social fabric across all of the diverse and thoughtful people of San Francisco.  Good faith disagreement is encouraged, as is the exploration of shared hopes and dreams.  Civility and refraining from personal attacks is required.  Sample topics include citizen assemblies, voting rights, virtuous deep fakes, AI and politics, questioning or reinventing our social contracts, creating reliable infrastructure, rethinking healthcare and more.

To learn more about us, please visit our Founding Principles page.  In 2021 we established our own retreat venue in the mountains near Yosemite National Park, about 140 miles due east of San Francisco.  Camp Earnest is our mountain paradise and has hosted about 35 companies and organizations and counting.  These groups are usually impact oriented, often touching on the arts or education, addressing climate change and ecological regeneration or with ambitions to create other kinds of deep systemic change.ABOUT MANNY'S:Manny's is a Town Hall, a Village Square, the place where anyone can meet and engage with civic leaders, elected officials, artists, activists, change makers and each other.The goal of Manny’s is to create a place to go to engage in civic and political life.We’re a place to go to watch the presidential debates, to actually meet the people working on the front lines of social change, to discuss the issues that matter with the policy makers themselves.On top of this, imagine a place where you can go just to hang in what feels like an extension of your living room.  That’s Manny’s.We offer our events space to nonprofits, activists, and civic organizations to do their work as well as host our own civic and arts-related programming.We are committed to the community, aspire to be useful, and welcome every single person into our doors with heart.

Chuy’s family grew their food in the backyard and always had a pot of something mouthwatering simmering on the stove. After graduating from the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco in 2005, he moved to Chicago to work at Frontera Grill under famed Chef Rick Bayless. He then served as Chef de Cuisine for Adobo Grill for their two locations in Chicago. In late 2009 he opened Chilam Balam in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago to local and national acclaim.  This lead to appearances on Bravo TV's Top Chef Season 9 as well as on Food TV’s Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. In 2013 Chuy moved back to Sonoma County and began to focus on food and wine pairing by working with local private chefs and caterers. This led to a four year stint as a Chef d’ Partie for Silver Oak Cellars where he collaborated with the Executive Winery Chef, creating and leading the food and wine pairing experience. We’re so excited to welcome Chuy to our roster of GP Dinner chefs and look forward to many gorgeous meals together.OUR MENU: TO START: Ahi Tuna Ceviche Tostada w/Avocado and Strawberry (GF)Crispy Maitake Mushrooms w/Pasilla Chile Drizzle (VE GF) Blue Corn Masa Empanada w/Toma Cheese, Molcajete Salsa (GF VG) MAINS: Grilled Brentwood Corn, Lime, Chile Quebrado, Cotija and Tat Soi (GF VG)Charred Baby Heirloom Squash w/Pumpkin Seed Mole (VE GF)Rancho Gordo Beans w/Quelites and Roasted Garlic (VE GF)Roasted Eggplant “Barbacoa” w/Tomatillo Salsa Verde (VE GF)Duroc Pork Spare Ribs Al Pastor w/Pineapple Pico de Gallo (GF DF)Banana Leaf Roasted Local Rock Cod w/Achiote and Pickled Manzanos (GF DF) TO FINISH: Tres Leches Cake, Hibiscus Macerated Summer Berries and Almond Praline (VG)Please email us at least 72 hours in advance if you have any dietary restrictions and we'll do our best to accommodate them.Drinks at 6:00, dinner at 7:00.

Our dominant culture survives on speed, which keeps problematic and oppressive structures in place at the devastating cost of our well-being and planetary health. Underbelly is a somatic response to the loss of slowness in an increasingly urgent world drowning in climate collapse, AI threat, technological addiction, diseased capitalism and polarization, as well as historical nervous system trauma from continuing racism, colonialism, and patriarchy. It’s time to dismantle the hurry and be in conversation with the present moment.This practice helps us explore the art of slowing down with ourselves, each other, and our current environment. There is space to metabolize our emotions, strengthen empathy and intuition, and develop an intimate relationship with our bodies and nature. We practice being in the questions themselves- listening and yielding to the intelligence of life without pushing, controlling, or fixing. Our individuation and togetherness are felt in a group field—deepening our presence and attunement with one another, co-regulating our nervous systems, being witnessed, held, considered, and noticed exactly as we are. We meet ourselves AS IS, without reaching for more or escaping/transcending reality.  We re-learn what it is to be relational instead of transactional.  To commune instead of consume. To be of service instead of self-serving. To rest back into the vastness and wildness of the natural world, releasing the tight circuits of programming, conditioning, and linearity we've known for so long.  Spend quality time with your body, breath, and being. Voyage beneath the surface of our fast culture, and dive into a slow sanctuary for unearthing what is alive, tender, and honest for you in every moment.​ This experience is not a solution, method, workshop or teaching of tools. It is not a business, ceremony, ecstatic dance, or dance class. It is a somatic gathering space that supports nervous system co-regulation, ample rest, and radical self/community care.

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator.

From the very first forms of mark-making to the caves of Lascaux to the works of Pablo Amaringo and Alex Grey, humanity has sought to understand our internal landscapes through visual expression. Alligator Lizards in the Air: Healing and Integration through Creative Expression, is a once a month chance to bring these experiences to life through two dimensional mark making.Art mediums from paint to colored pencils, crayons to markers, will be available for everyone to use along with paper and canvas. Krisztina Lazar will be your visionary guide in creativity and will help you realize your experience before your eyes. No art background needed for this class. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to explore. Krisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today’s cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California."

BREATHE. BE…What is forest bathing?Forest Therapy, also known as ""Shinrin-Yoku,"" refers to the practice of spending time in forested areas to enhance health, wellness, and happiness. The practice focuses on the idea that spending time simply breathing in the natural world is beneficial and healing.Walk Leader Roz Greenfield: Roz is a successful entrepreneur and tech executive. To counteract the high velocity and stress of the tech world, she has turned to nature as a way to bring better balance into her life. As her relationship with nature deepened, she found the practice of Forest Bathing has enhanced her experience and made time spent in nature more meaningful. She is deeply concerned about the human impact on our climate and believes that the practice of Forest Bathing deepens our connection to nature, leading to an increased awareness and more respectful relationship with nature. As a Certified Forest Bathing guide, she partners with the forest to provide a doorway and framework for humans to be in reciprocity with nature. Within this space of balanced offering and receiving, she provides a way for people to not only reconnect with nature but to take better care of our environment as a result. Roz holds a Forest Bathing certification from ANFT and a Wilderness First Aid certification from Survival Med.What to expect: ~ A leisurely walk of less than a mile.

Our dominant culture survives on speed, which keeps problematic and oppressive structures in place at the devastating cost of our well-being and planetary health. Underbelly is a somatic response to the loss of slowness in an increasingly urgent world drowning in climate collapse, AI threat, technological addiction, diseased capitalism and polarization, as well as historical nervous system trauma from continuing racism, colonialism, and patriarchy. It’s time to dismantle the hurry and be in conversation with the present moment.This practice helps us explore the art of slowing down with ourselves, each other, and our current environment. There is space to metabolize our emotions, strengthen empathy and intuition, and develop an intimate relationship with our bodies and nature. We practice being in the questions themselves- listening and yielding to the intelligence of life without pushing, controlling, or fixing. Our individuation and togetherness are felt in a group field—deepening our presence and attunement with one another, co-regulating our nervous systems, being witnessed, held, considered, and noticed exactly as we are. We meet ourselves AS IS, without reaching for more or escaping/transcending reality.  We re-learn what it is to be relational instead of transactional.  To commune instead of consume. To be of service instead of self-serving. To rest back into the vastness and wildness of the natural world, releasing the tight circuits of programming, conditioning, and linearity we've known for so long.  Spend quality time with your body, breath, and being. Voyage beneath the surface of our fast culture, and dive into a slow sanctuary for unearthing what is alive, tender, and honest for you in every moment.​ This experience is not a solution, method, workshop or teaching of tools. It is not a business, ceremony, ecstatic dance, or dance class. It is a somatic gathering space that supports nervous system co-regulation, ample rest, and radical self/community care.

Much like the phoenix submitting itself to the fire to be reborn, there is a pinnacle of intensity where everything within us is tested. Surrounded by the extreme heat, things snap  into focus. Will the vessel hold? Or will it shatter? The artworks included in this show embody this moment of pressure-testing in a variety of ways. When we examine the times in our own lives when we  submit our emotions, our senses, and our very being to the raging fires of change , the question of  whether or not we can take any more can flip to new resolve, clarity, and strength. Our vessel, our container, and our body bear witness to these moments when the heat is so intense that the  metal of our inner resolve becomes molten and we are able to  transform difficulty into determination, flow, and movement. Each piece in “The Crucible”  speaks to this magical process, whether as the vessel, the fire, or the metal within. C﻿urated by Krisztina LazarKrisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today’s cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California.V﻿olunteer to help with this event Volunteer Here  ArtistsLarraine SeidenBells HowardGage OlesenChris IsnerJennifer RobertsThailan WhenYabette SwankQuinn KeckKathryn BarronHeather Chou SontagTim ArmstrongMay M.

I highly recommend other investors to judge and attend the programs, and startups to attend or pitch.""+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Endorsement from Michael Gibstine, Managing Director, Hanover International. ”I work in Silicon Valley and attend many venture forums and investment summits.   If you select one event to attend this year, I highly recommend Angel Launch events, either Silicon Valley Funding Summit in Las Vegas or  Silicon Valley Investing Summit on Oct 1 in San Francisco. I have known the founder Zahava Stroud for eight years, and she produces the best regarded, highest quality summits for startups and investors.

The events are impeccably organized with well crafted, thoughtful agendas addressing emerging tech trends; excellent speakers from top tier investment firms, VCs, corporate brands, and angels; and high level networking opportunities with demo tables.  I have had follow up discussions with many high quality startups or advanced growth companies seeking capital.

Digital tech, such as the internet and AI, do so with an increasingly faster pace. However, historically technology (and science) has also created significant risks - from climate ones (e.g., the industrial revolution) to extinction ones (e.g., nuclear). Are digital innovations accelerating risks as well as opportunities? What risks, and how to manage them? How can we continue to innovate while managing the downside(s)? What is the role of management, leadership, and governance - including regulations - to this purpose? What are some key challenges we need to overcome and opportunities created on the way to doing so? Can we get the best of all worlds: the EU regulatory and human rights focus, the Valley tech innovation focus and the China fast development focus? In this event we will discuss these issues both more generally and then more specifically with a panel of executives. L﻿earning outcome:- Specific tech risks and governance as well as regulatory approaches to manage them
- Implications of (not) managing online and AI trust & safety for business, society and geopolitics

This area was referred to as ""over the tracks"" by the residents of Parchester Village, one of the few communities where minorities were allowed to purchase homes after World War II. The new residents were promised the marsh would always be open for recreation, nature appreciation, and views of the water. Beginning in the 1970's, it appeared that promise would be broken, as developers schemed to drain the marsh and develop the wetlands. Parchester resident Reverend Richard Dotson and his son, Whitney, led the community in a campaign to preserve the wetlands, stating ""everyone neglects the needs of low income communities to access to quality of life.""Ultimately,  the wetland area was acquired by the East Bay Regional Park District and the marsh renamed  in honor of the Dotson family. The Park District  has worked to restore the wetlands ecosystem and  protect Parchester Village from rising sea level and other dangers of climate change.O﻿ur adventure also includes hiking the beautiful Bay View and Woods trails, where we'll explore the serene natural  and explosive cultural history of the park area, host to numerous dynamite factories beginning in the 1880's through mid 20th century.N﻿orth Richmond is a Greenbelt Alliance Resilience Hotspot.

Generating over half of the state’s greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state’s transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA’s Climate Roadmap tackles the city’s ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city’s eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation.
