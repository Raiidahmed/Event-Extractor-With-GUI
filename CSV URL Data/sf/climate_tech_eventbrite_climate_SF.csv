From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

Our programming is designed to encourage deep connections between attendees and help answer hard questions about textile-derived ocean pollution (i.e. microfiber pollution), climate change, textile waste, green chemistry, ocean-thoughtful material alternatives, and more.  This year's Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will be 5 hours - allowing time for educational programming, connecting deeply, and putting up the sails to enjoy some sailing! Participants will have the option to assist with sailing, or we welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. The longer sail will allow us to spend more time outside of the Golden Gate Bridge and see more of the San Francisco Bay! Educational activities include demonstrations of marine research techniques and participation in ""Educational Tastings"" - a series of short expert presentations that inspire conversation and discussion. Our tastings are facilitated by leaders at the intersection of Textile X Ocean with diverse backgrounds and a passion for knowledge-sharing.On board, you will learn how microfiber pollution is measured, what we know about the potential sources and pathways for fiber pollution in our region, discuss solutions at the forefront of our Textile X Ocean community, and upcoming ways to get involved in furthering research and solutions.Lisa Erdle, 5 Gyres Director of Science and Innovation joined the 2022 sail to help lead a demonstration on techniques to monitor microfiber pollution in water bodies.

Please feel free to share this invitation with your colleagues or other interested parties that may like to join.A range of stakeholders from industry, brands, research entities, and environmental non-profits joined the 2022 sail with many new partnerships and relationships formed. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyABOUT THE ORGANIZERSTogether, Krystle Moody Wood and Carolynn Box have established themselves as some of the world's leading experts in microfiber pollution- an issue easily recognized at the intersection of oceans and textiles. With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyCarlie Herring, a research scientist at NOAA Marine Debris Program and co-author of the SOS 2.0 Report on Microfiber Pollution, is providing guests with an overview of the upcoming congressional report to spark discussion with attendees about federal action and policy.

In each module we also explore some of the processes of the human brain that influence our behavior, such as cognitive biases and emotions, and discuss important considerations like ethics, scarcity, and equity that practitioners should always keep in mind when designing behavior change initiatives, policies, and strategies.📌 INITIATE:  The Foundations of Success The INITIATE phase is designed to set practitioners up for success by helping you strategically identify, evaluate, and select the environmental challenges, audiences, and specific behaviors on which to focus the initiative for maximum impact. We also discuss where in the system you will have the greatest leverage in our introduction to systems thinking. The guidance provided in this module will help you complete these steps from scratch, or it can augment your organization’s existing strategic planning processes and systems. Not only will the work done in this phase help you select the most impactful, achievable, and scalable audience and behavior to work with, the research you do will inform everything you do in later phases. 📌 UNCOVER: An Evidence-Based Approach to Unlocking What Drives Your Audience's Behavior (Part 1: Means, Motivation, & Memory) UNCOVER the factors that are truly driving your audience’s behavior. What’s stopping them from taking action, and how can you help them overcome this? The Uncover phase is separated into two modules. In this module, you'll learn about the major drivers - barriers and  motivators or fuel and friction - of behavior, which are mapped into three categories: Means (can I do it?), Motivation (do I want to do it?), and Memory (can I remember to do it?). While it can be tempting to skip straight to solutions, taking the time to listen to and deeply understand your audience is at the heart of the Making Shift Happen process—ignoring or making assumptions about why people are or are not adopting a behavior can waste resources or even backfire. This module is a must!📌 UNCOVER: An Evidence-Based Approach to Unlocking What Drives Your Audience's Behavior (Part 2: How to conduct a Behavior Drivers Analysis)UNCOVER the factors that are truly driving your audience’s behavior. What’s stopping them from taking action, and how can you help them overcome this? The Uncover phase is separated into two modules. You will walk from this module with the knowledge and tools you need to conduct a Behavior Determinants Analysis to reveal your audience’s barriers, beliefs, values, motivations and more, and how to leverage these to bring about the behaviors and actions you want.  ANY organization (no matter how small) can complete a low-cost, low-tech, high-impact analysis to obtain evidence based results and we show you how. (Note: we recommend you take Module 2 before taking this module). 📌 DESIGN: Creating the Solutions That Shift BehaviorIn this module you will learn to use what you know about your issue area, audience, and behavior to DESIGN a complete suite of behavioral shifters - evidence-based behavior change solutions - that address  barriers the audience faces so you can achieve your goals. You’ll use science-backed shifters from the Making Shift Happen Behavioral Building Blocks™  to accomplish this. You will also learn audience segmentation approaches so your solutions have the best chance of success. No matter how perfect the solution, unless it works for the audience and is rolled out effectively it may not be taken up by key stakeholders; in this module we take a deep dive into prototyping - which allows you to identify problems and make necessary adjustments to your behavior change messages and initiatives quickly and affordably - before you use substantial resources to roll them out.Solutions, Solutions → The Making Shift Happen Behavioral Building Blocks™​​​​Once you’ve selected the behaviors you want to change, it’s time to start the process of planning which behavioral strategies you are going to use to achieve the change you seek. There are hundreds of techniques (also called interventions) for shifting our audiences' behaviors. We have identified the best, most powerful time-tested solutions and divided them into 10 easy to understand Behavioral Building Blocks™, each covered in one module. Our Behavioral Building Blocks™ framework is based on thousands of research articles, real-world case studies, and years of our own experience. For a summary on each Building Block, please read on.📌 Highlight Norms to Leverage BELONGINGWhy do you save energy? Is it to protect the environment? Benefit society? Save money? Because others are doing it? If you’re like most people, you don’t believe that knowing what your peers are doing has much, if any, effect on your behavior. However, although people tend to underestimate the degree to which others influence their own behavior, social norms are among the most powerful motivators of behavior change. In this module, you'll learn how to use social norms to ensure that environmental behaviors spread and are durable.📌 Make it EASY How many of us have waited until the last minute to file our taxes? How many times have you stopped filling out a form when it took too long? In today’s busy and ever-changing world, we are asked to take many different actions every single day and even every hour. To optimize our limited time, attention, and energy, we often take the path of least resistance. Even minor inconveniences, or hassle factors, can cause us to move on to easier or more pressing matters. In this module, we discuss tips for making the desired behaviors as simple, seamless, and convenient as possible. We’ll also explore adding friction to make undesirable behaviors difficult to complete.📌 Cultivate Powerful HABITS Have you ever driven halfway to work without even realizing it? While learning a new behavior, like driving a car, requires focused concentration, with frequent repetition the brain creates neurological pathways that reinforce a pattern to the point where the behavior becomes so automatic we don’t have to pay attention at all. Because our brains are constantly trying to save time and energy, the ""path of least resistance"" subconsciously guides much of our daily behavior. This module provides a variety of tools to support our target audiences in building durable positive habits by shaping the first actions toward change, introducing new contextual cues to trigger desired actions, and reinforcing these actions with practice, feedback, and incentives. This chapter also provides a variety of tools to support breaking habits by disrupting old cues and response links.📌 Activate ATTACHMENT We all have things that we are attached to, such as the people, animals, or places that we love the most, certain activities, and our culture and customs. When we care deeply about something, we experience powerful emotions that motivate us to protect or preserve it, and we prioritize the things that are in line with the morals and ideals that guide our judgments. However, we sometimes lose sight of how integral our environment is to all the things we are attached to. In this module, you'll learn how to help your audience see the connection between the environmental issues you work on and the people, experiences, places, values, morals, and ideologies that they are attached to.📌 Design it to be VIVID Why do we notice and remember some things, while others ""go in one ear and out the other""? In our fast-paced and technology-driven society, we are bombarded by messages competing for our attention every day—from billboards, to pop-ups on our phones, to signs in the grocery store. The sheer volume of information—all of which claims to be important—results in information overload and, ultimately, attention fatigue. We simply can’t process and respond to all the messages presented to us—even those about things that are truly important to us. Given the critical importance of what information is most noticeable and memorable, environmental practitioners face a critical challenge and opportunity. To be successful, we must design initiatives that not only take attention fatigue into account, but also overcome it. This module is about how to overcome attention fatigue by making our messages as noticeable, engaging, and memorable as possible.📌 Leverage our need for consistent IDENTITY We each carry multiple identities, such as that of a student, sibling, professional, or parent. Each identity is shaped by our individual expectations for ourselves and by the expectations placed on us by others. If we fail to fulfill the expectations associated with our identity, we risk the inconsistency disappointing ourselves or others. Our drive to be consistent with our most strongly held values and societal roles shapes every aspect of our lives, including how we interact with others, how we respond to messages in our environment, and how we behave on a daily basis. This module provides tools to leverage your audience's drive to be consistent with their identities so as to encourage environmental behaviors. 📌 Empower through active OPTIMISM Sea levels are rising. Wildfires are blazing out of control. Species teeter on the brink of extinction as ecosystems are threatened by human activity and a changing climate. When this is all we hear about the environment, it’s no wonder we find ourselves feeling overwhelmed or even paralyzed. The truth is, most of us do care about the health of the planet, but many environmental issues feel daunting, abstract, and outside of our individual control. These feelings are amplified when environmental practitioners highlight the catastrophic nature of a problem, guided by the mistaken assumption that this strategy will not only grab people’s attention but also make them more likely to act. In this module, you will learn to empower your audiences through active optimism: the kind of optimism that is rooted in action. Active optimism isn’t just about believing that the outcome will be positive, it’s also about feeling empowered and capable of taking action to make that outcome a reality. This kind of optimism is a crucial driver of transformational, enduring environmental change.📌 Judiciously use REWARDS In an ideal world, everyone would be motivated to engage in environmental behaviors all of the time. Everyone would believe that the costs of the environmental behaviors (like the extra time it takes to sort our food into compost bins) are outweighed by the benefits (like the reduced emissions from food in landfills), even if those benefits will be realized far into the future. However, in reality, few of us are sufficiently motivated by distant, diffused, or intangible rewards. Sometimes your audience will require an extra incentive to make the benefits of environmental behavior outweigh the costs and to overcome the psychological and social barriers to behavior change. In this module you will learn the best practices for designing and delivering rewards and penalties to motivate positive environmental behavior.📌 Frame for the appropriate ASSOCIATIONS Framing information in a way that activates meaningful mental associations is essential for encouraging a shift in mindsets toward environmental engagement. You'll learn about frames that have already been tested, especially climate frames, how to avoid detrimental frames. You will also learn about the power of metaphors and how to test your own metaphors and frames.📌 Expanding the self to ensure nature's LONGEVITYWhat about the type of transformational change that can shift the mindset of an entire society? People need intrinsic motivation--motivation that arises from within--to continue to take action for the environment long after our initiatives are gone. In a society that values productivity and economic output above all else, it's hardly surprising that we find it difficult to slow down, to connect with nature, and even to know ourselves. In addition, we are continuously bombarded with bad news – and, as climate change accelerates, the news will get worse before it gets better. At worst, we may find ourselves isolated in a ""bubble"" that causes us to lose our empathy and compassion for others and nature. This loss of connection can lower our long-term motivation to care for others and protect our environment, making the barriers to behavior change even harder to overcome. This module discusses how to change mindsets by building intrinsic motivation to protect the environment. Activating intrinsic motivation is essential to creating permanent, transformational changes in how we live on this planet. This is by no means a quick fix, but it is an enduring one.WHO ARE THE TRAINERS?Training and break-out room facilitation are conducted by Root Solutions staff.

Her extensive achievements as a performer, author, recording and visual artist is acknowledged worldwide.Released in 1975, Smith’s first recording, Horses, was inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2010 by the National Recording Preservation Board. Her subsequent albums include Radio Ethiopia, Easter, which included Because the Night, cowritten with Bruce Springsteen, Wave, Dream of Life, which included People Have the Power cowritten with her late husband Fred Sonic Smith, Gone Again, Peace and Noise, Gung Ho, Trampin’, Land, Twelve, Banga, and Outside Society. She is a four-time Grammy® nominee and a Golden Globe nominee for the song “Mercy Is” cowritten with Lenny Kay for the film Noah. Steven Sebring’s 2008 documentary, Patti Smith: Dream of Life, received an Emmy nomination.Patti Smith was awarded the prestigious 2010 National Book Award for her bestselling memoir, Just Kids, chronicling her deep friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and the evolution of their work. Her books include Witt, Babel, Woolgathering, The Coral Sea, Auguries of Innocence, Collected Lyrics, M Train, Devotion and Year of the Monkey. A Book of Days, featuring 365 images and reflections will be published in November 2022.Smith holds the honor of “Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres” from the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She was honored by ASCAP with the Founders Award in 2010, representing lifetime achievement, and was the recipient of Sweden’s 2011 Polar Award, an international acknowledgement for significant achievements in music. In 2013, Smith received the Katharine Hepburn Medal from Bryn Mawr College, recognizing women whose contributions embody the drive and work ethic of the celebrated actress. In 2014, Barnard College Board of Trustees presented Patti Smith with their Medal of Distinction. In 2016, she was awarded the Burke Medal for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Trinity College, Dublin. Smith’s photographs, drawings, and installations have been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide. Coupled with her photography exhibit Higher Learning, Smith received the Laurea Magistrate causa  from Parma, Italy and an honorary doctorate in Euro-American Literature from Padova University. She was awarded The Badge of the Austrian Decoration of Science and Art in 2019.2020 Smith received the literary service prize from PEN America and the Wall Street Journal acknowledged her as a Literature Innovator and in May 2022 received the Doctor of Humane Letters from Columbia University as well as receiving the distinction of being named an Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honor by decree of the  President of the French Republic.Her renowned band includes guitarist and author Lenny Kaye, who she has collaborated with since 1971, drummer Jay Dee Daugherty since 1975, Tony Shanahan on bass and keyboards, since 1996, and her son, guitarist Jackson Smith, for over a decade. BOB MOULDBob Mould began his career as one of the angry upstarts of the hardcore punk scene, and over several decades he's matured into one of the elder statesmen of alternative rock without giving up his integrity, his intelligence, or the fierce passion of his best music. In the early '80s, Mould emerged as one of the founding members of Hüsker Dü, a Minneapolis-based punk band who blended furiously fast tempos with melodic pop structures on influential, groundbreaking albums like 1984's Zen Arcade and 1985's New Day Rising. After the breakup of Hüsker Dü, Mould launched a solo career with 1989's introspective, largely acoustic Workbook, but soon returned to a hard, angry sound on 1990's Black Sheets of Rain. In 1992, Mould formed another band, Sugar, who picked up where the pop-oriented sound of Hüsker Dü left off on albums like 1992's Copper Blue and 1994's File Under: Easy Listening. After Sugar split up in 1995, Mould returned to solo work, dividing his time between guitar-oriented efforts like 1998's The Last Dog and Pony Show and projects like 2002's Modulate that reflected his growing interest in electronic music. Mould walked a middle ground between the two styles on 2008's District Line, but with 2012's Silver Age, he recommitted himself to fluid but aggressive rock. It was the first in a series of albums that reaffirmed his status as one of indie rock's strongest talents, and 2019's Sunshine Rock and 2020's Blue Hearts were celebrated as some of the best music of his life.At present Smith writes, performs, lending support for human-rights issues and environmental groups, primarily Pathway to Paris, a nonprofit organization co-founded by her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith, offering tangible solutions for combatting global climate.

From the very first forms of mark-making to the caves of Lascaux to the works of Pablo Amaringo and Alex Grey, humanity has sought to understand our internal landscapes through visual expression. Alligator Lizards in the Air: Healing and Integration through Creative Expression, is a once a month chance to bring these experiences to life through two dimensional mark making.Art mediums from paint to colored pencils, crayons to markers, will be available for everyone to use along with paper and canvas. Krisztina Lazar will be your visionary guide in creativity and will help you realize your experience before your eyes. No art background needed for this class. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to explore. Krisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today’s cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California."

A﻿ movement score will be offered from Jennifer Monson/iLAND. Jennifer Monson (iLAND) is a choreographer, performer, and teacher. Since 1983, she has explored strategies in choreography, improvisation, and collaboration in experimental dance. In 2000, her work took a new turn to investigate the relationship between movement and environment. This ongoing research has led her into inquiries of cultural and scientific understandings of large-scale phenomena such as animal navigation and migration, geological formations such as aquifers, and re-functioned sites such as the abandoned Ridgewood Reservoir. These studies provide the means to unearth and inquire into choreographic and embodied ways of knowing and reimagining our relationship to the environments and spaces humans/all beings inhabit. Her projects BIRD BRAIN (2000-2005), iMAP/Ridgewood Reservoir (2007), and the Mahomet Aquifer Project (2008-2010), SIP (sustained immersive process)/watershed are investigations that have radically reframed the role dance plays in our cultural understandings of nature and wilderness. Her current work Live Dancing Archive proposes that choreography itself is an archival practice for environmental phenomena. N﻿TAFLF- No one turned away for lack of funds.

Some went so far as to propose that these “intermediate sexes” might, in fact, constitute a totally different species, even serve as intrepid guides in our march toward an uncertain future.The five speculative stories in Theodore McCombs’s kaleidoscopic collection span several possible worlds, teasing the boundaries between coexisting realities and taking up the question of queer difference from one surprising vantage after another. In “Toward a Theory of Alternative Lifestyles,” a heartbroken gay man waits in line at an exclusive Berlin rave promising visions of parallel lives across the multiverse. In “Six Hangings in the Land of Unkillable Women,” at the turn of an alternate 20th century, a policeman’s wife feels that if you want an execution done right, you just have to do it yourself. And in the operatic novella “Uranians,” an expedition of queer artists, scientists, and one trans priest embark on a lifelong interplanetary voyage that requires them to renegotiate their connections to a remote and hostile Earth, while keeping their ship’s biome—and each other—alive.Theodore McCombs's stories have appeared in Guernica, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and the anthology Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy. Born in Thousand Oaks, California, he is a graduate of the University of California, San Diego, UC Berkeley School of Law, and the Clarion Writers Workshop. He lives in San Diego with his partner and their surly old cat and practices environmental law, with a focus on climate change.Colin Winnette is the author of several books, translated into multiple languages, including Haints Stay and The Job of the Wasp. His new novel Users was one of the New Yorker's ""Best Books of 2023"" and was called ""...a timeless and moving story about fatherhood and one man’s yearning for a more meaningful life,"" by the NY Times. His writing has appeared in numerous publications, including McSweeney's, Playboy, and BOMB Magazine. He lives in San Francisco, and you can find him online at colinwinnette.net."

No problem. Heavy Middle Eastern spice? Got it. Bitter green asparagus? Bring it on! From the Atlantic to edges of Burgundy, the hills and valley's of the Loire offer many cool and interesting wines to discover. Better still, are the current crop of young and talented winemakers pushing the boundaries of organics and biodynamics to create wines of pure varietal expression.In this tasting, we make our way through Muscadet, Sancerre, Vouvray, Savennieres, Borgeuil and Chinon, to discover a rich history of winemaking and innovation. As we follow the river Loire and its tributaries, participants will gain insight into each village, their associated grapes and styles. This tasting will feature wines representing both traditional houses and winemakers making waves today.SERIES DESCRIPTION: 'Through the Glass' are one-of-a-kind wine experiences where history, cuisine and the culture of winemaking are presented together to provide an immersive educational experience. In contrast with classes found at culinary schools, restaurants and wineries, this program reflects a single sommelier working experience with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and American wines. With maps, informational booklets and a curated selection of wines to light the way, Paul leads participants deep into the chosen subject, providing not only wine education but a snapshot of a place and its people.FINE PRINT:- All attendees must be at least 21 years of age.- All sales are final- Participants will receive 1.5 ounce pours from each bottle- The duration of the tasting will be 90-120minHOW TO BOOK1. Follow link to Eventbrite page.  2. Select class, number of tickets and purchase.  3. Recieve welcome email from me, including all details.  4. Receive final confirmation email 24hrs prior to classWHAT TO EXPECT: Tastings begin with a brief rapid-fire presentation on history, geography, climate and soil. Once the stage has been set, I then lead a round-table discussion which includes a sensory evaluation of each wine and information on good service, suggested food pairings and much more. Tastings run between 90-120 minutes in length. Participants will receive a collateral booklet to follow along and make notes. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Classes are designed for all levels of wine experience/education, from newbies to aficionados. There are no ""amateur questions"" and I vigorously protect the opinions of all my attendees. THE VENUE: The Prima Materia tasting room is located at 482 #B, 49th St, Oakland, CA 94609. The venue holds a maximum of 12 participants, seated comfortably on high stools with cushions provided. At the apex of the space will be my perch, surrounded by maps and anything I need to deliver a great wine experience. The room has been outfitted with a modern overhead vent, which provides a steady current of air. Windows along the street-side of the space will remain open for ventilation. Participants are encouraged to wear a comfortable sweater or jacket to combat the draft, until the weather breaks and I can move the tastings outside. That’s right, there is a beautiful outside area I absolutely cannot wait to expand into once the weather turns! THE WINES: Classes will typically feature 7 wines poured in 2-3 flights. Participants will receive a 1.5-2oz pour from each bottle, with a little left over for revisiting. Over the years, I learned the success of a class begins with an above-average selection of wines reflecting the best possible expressions from a given area. This not only includes benchmark wineries, but also smaller producers who are doing amazing things in the vineyard and winery. ABOUT YOUR SOMMELIER: Paul Robinson has been in the hospitality business for over 15 years. His career began in the private event business in NYC, where he led large-scale galas and dinners for Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. After a meaningful trip to Italy, he pursued certification as a sommelier in CA before moving into restaurants full-time. First, for a brief stint in Yountville, then to SF, where he led an extensive wine and cheese program at Chiaroscuro Ristorante. After several years, Paul moved back to NYC to be near family. He poured wine at Del Posto, further deepening his knowledge and appreciation of Italian wines. After departing Del Posto, Paul found a local retail shop/school which would plant the seed for a future business: curating educational deep dives into important regions and appellations all over the wine world. CA beckoned him to return and he has spent the last 3 years running a new business BOTTIVINO.Paul is a certified sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers and a member of the ruling council of the Cavalieri del Tartufo e Dei Vini di Alba - SF Bay Area chapter.

Home to the culinary treasures of Napoli, pristine beaches of the Amalfi coast, forests of Cilento and ancient volcanic soils of Vesuvius, Campanian wine speaks of place, loudly!In this class, we take a closer look at this formidable region and its range of ancient grapes. From the coastline of the Mediterranean to the Apennine foothills, participants will discover the wines Avellino, Taburno, Amalfi, Vesuvius and Cilento. We will dive into the history of Aglianico, the range of Fiano available today, along with other grapes like Greco di Tufo, Piedirosso, Falanghina and more, each with its own unique history in the area.SERIES DESCRIPTION: 'Through the Glass' are one-of-a-kind wine experiences where history, cuisine and the culture of winemaking are presented together to provide an immersive educational experience. In contrast with classes found at culinary schools, restaurants and wineries, this program reflects a single sommelier working experience with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and American wines. With maps, informational booklets and a curated selection of wines to light the way, Paul leads participants deep into the chosen subject, providing not only wine education but a snapshot of a place and its people.FINE PRINT:- All attendees must be at least 21 years of age.- All sales are final- Participants will receive 1.5 ounce pours from each bottle- The duration of the tasting will be 90-120minHOW TO BOOK1. Follow link to Eventbrite page.  2. Select class, number of tickets and purchase.  3. Recieve welcome email from me, including all details.  4. Receive final confirmation email 24hrs prior to classWHAT TO EXPECT: Tastings begin with a brief rapid-fire presentation on history, geography, climate and soil. Once the stage has been set, I then lead a round-table discussion which includes a sensory evaluation of each wine and information on good service, suggested food pairings and much more. Tastings run between 90-120 minutes in length. Participants will receive a collateral booklet to follow along and make notes. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Classes are designed for all levels of wine experience/education, from newbies to aficionados. There are no ""amateur questions"" and I vigorously protect the opinions of all my attendees. THE VENUE: The Prima Materia tasting room is located at 482 #B, 49th St, Oakland, CA 94609. The venue holds a maximum of 12 participants, seated comfortably on high stools with cushions provided. At the apex of the space will be my perch, surrounded by maps and anything I need to deliver a great wine experience. The room has been outfitted with a modern overhead vent, which provides a steady current of air. Windows along the street-side of the space will remain open for ventilation. Participants are encouraged to wear a comfortable sweater or jacket to combat the draft, until the weather breaks and I can move the tastings outside. That’s right, there is a beautiful outside area I absolutely cannot wait to expand into once the weather turns! THE WINES: Classes will typically feature 7 wines poured in 2-3 flights. Participants will receive a 1.5-2oz pour from each bottle, with a little left over for revisiting. Over the years, I learned the success of a class begins with an above-average selection of wines reflecting the best possible expressions from a given area. This not only includes benchmark wineries, but also smaller producers who are doing amazing things in the vineyard and winery. ABOUT YOUR SOMMELIER: Paul Robinson has been in the hospitality business for over 15 years. His career began in the private event business in NYC, where he led large-scale galas and dinners for Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. After a meaningful trip to Italy, he pursued certification as a sommelier in CA before moving into restaurants full-time. First, for a brief stint in Yountville, then to SF, where he led an extensive wine and cheese program at Chiaroscuro Ristorante. After several years, Paul moved back to NYC to be near family. He poured wine at Del Posto, further deepening his knowledge and appreciation of Italian wines. After departing Del Posto, Paul found a local retail shop/school which would plant the seed for a future business: curating educational deep dives into important regions and appellations all over the wine world. CA beckoned him to return and he has spent the last 3 years running a new business BOTTIVINO.Paul is a certified sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers and a member of the ruling council of the Cavalieri del Tartufo e Dei Vini di Alba - SF Bay Area chapter. He lives in Oakland and pours wines part-time at Ungrafted in SF."

David and Diane were pioneers of the western edge of the Sonoma Coast when they planted Coastlands Vineyard with their son Ross in 1989.After spending nearly a decade honing his winemaking skills, Ross approached his parents with the idea of founding Cobb Wines with a vision that would allow the family to guide every step of the process, from the farming of the vineyard to the crafting of a style that celebrated the site. The first vintage of Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir was a mere 130 cases. The wine sold quickly, and Ross never looked back. Today, Cobb Wines’ ethos is centered around three estate vineyards, a focus on cool climate sites, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Riesling.Please join us, as Ross Cobb, owner and winemaker, guides us through a tasting of Cobb wines paired with a multi-course menu.MENUMt.

Our dominant culture survives on speed, which keeps problematic and oppressive structures in place at the devastating cost of our well-being and planetary health. Underbelly is a somatic response to the loss of slowness in an increasingly urgent world drowning in climate collapse, AI threat, technological addiction, diseased capitalism and polarization, as well as historical nervous system trauma from continuing racism, colonialism, and patriarchy. It's time to dismantle the hurry.  This practice helps us explore the art of slowing down with ourselves, each other, and our current environment. There is space to metabolize our emotions, strengthen empathy and intuition, and develop an intimate relationship with our bodies and nature. We practice being in the questions themselves- listening and yielding to the intelligence of life without pushing, controlling, or fixing. Our individuation and togetherness are felt in a group field—deepening our presence and attunement with one another, co-regulating our nervous systems, being witnessed, held, considered, and noticed exactly as we are. We meet ourselves AS IS, without reaching for more or escaping/transcending reality.  We re-learn what it is to be relational instead of transactional.  To commune instead of consume. To be of service instead of self-serving. To rest back into the vastness and wildness of the natural world, releasing the tight circuits of programming, conditioning, and linearity we've known for so long.  Spend quality time with your body, breath, and being. Voyage beneath the surface of our fast culture, and dive into a slow sanctuary for unearthing what is alive, tender, and honest for you in every moment.​ This experience is not a solution, method, workshop or teaching of tools. It is not a business, ceremony, ecstatic dance, dance class or conscious dance space. It is a somatic gathering space that supports nervous system co-regulation, ample rest, and radical self/community care. About the Creator:Amy Rogg (she/her) is an activator and nurturer of the human spirit. She is half Taiwanese/half Jewish, born in Denver Colorado and raised mostly in the Bay Area.

Grief and its accompanying emotions like anger, frustration, loneliness, and confusion can be overwhelming to process alone. Whether your grief is from surviving the loss of a loved one, a breakup, a life transition, or bearing witness to the calamities of our planet including climate grief and the multiple pandemics from police violence to COVID-19, this gathering is for you. Whatever leads your heart to a place of being broken is enough.Some of the oldest artifacts known to humankind are from grief rituals, yet in modern times this sacred and necessary space is hard to come by due to our collective discomfort around loss. During our time together you will be guided through movement, meditation, creative practices, sound healing therapies, and group sharing. Inn our ritual space we will have the opportunity to metabolize our losses and transmute them into a gift for our own hearts and the heart of the collective.To bring: Please bring a lawnchair, beach towel ,blanket, or yoga mat, journal, any art supplies, and an object of significance that represents the grief you are holding.A note on fee: If the supported rate tickets are sold out and/or you are in need of a reduced fee, please reach out with a sentence or two about why you are seeking a partial scholarship at this time. We have a couple of spots available for this with preference given to BIPPOC, trans/nonbiniary folks, and those with disabilities. We also have openings for a helper to offer service in exchange for ticket. Please inquire if you are interested! Is this gathering a good fit for me? Here some things to consider before joining:1. This would be a good fit if your grief is not overwhelming (i.e. you can still be present in daily life and have some capacity to talk about your grief even if it's just a sentence or two).2. This would be a good fit if you already have some support and help in your life - relationships and self-care practices - and this offering is a supplement to those.3. This would be a good fit if you are open to sharing your grief in a welcoming and confidential space, and feel it would be supportive to your experience, and you are open to witnessing and being present with others as they share their grief, even if it's a different kind of grief than yours.COVID-19 protocol:If you are experiencing a high temperature or any symptoms that may indicate signs of Covid, please do not attend this event. The entire event will be outdoors and masks are optional. If you want to bring any snack item to share, please consider individually wrapped items.About the FacilitatorsAmy Hyun Swart (she/her) is a somatic and expressive arts-based psychotherapist specializing in grief and trauma. She leads grief gatherings, workshops, and rituals, both in-person and online and passionately views grief as a form of activism and a powerful element necessary for collective healing and liberation.

The ritual was probably something that I really needed for my own closure. I felt so loved and connected. What amazes me is that I was cared for by strangers! ““My first time attending a grief ritual. I had no idea how powerful it was, in its simplicity and clear focus on giving us permission to really name our losses and grieve in a safe ritually held space. I really felt different afterward. My heart was soothed.”“I felt held and seen as I was able to be with some really difficult feelings. Through ritual, song, and connection, Amy and Phoenix showed us that we are not alone in our grief, that it is okay to be with our experience however we may need to. What a special day.”""It was my first time participating in a Grief Ceremony and I'm so grateful to have experienced it with Amy and Phoenix. I appreciate the beautiful sacred and safe container that was created to grieve and celebrate together in community. Amy and Phoenix are skillful facilitators and wonderfully wove together poetry, music, and movement into a deep and heartfelt ceremony.""""I appreciated the guidance provided during that time as well with the visualizations. Spending a lot of time in the head space around grief, it really helped me to connect somatically.""""I'd recommend this group. There is a lot packed in a short time. Definitely worthwhile""""Grief Gathering with Amy and Phoenix is a wonderful invitation to deeply acquaint with whatever grief is present. The care and intention they both offer creates a safe, healing space to hold everything that comes up. The practices they facilitate lend to an embodied grief experience contributing to healing, deeply honoring the capacity of the heart.""""This was so needed. It gave me space to release more grief from a familial loss I was dealing with before COVID-19. Then allowed space for releasing even more specific to COVID dynamics and anti-Blackness/violence in a way that felt contained and supportive. Thanks for this space!""“I loved the diversity of people and experiences.”“This experience was different in a good way. I’m so used to expressing myself through words so it was interesting using sound, movement, and art.”""I really liked the EMDR work. This was surprising to me -- I appreciated the guidance provided during that time as well with the visualizations. Spending a lot of time in the head space around grief, it really helped me to connect somatically.""""I really enjoyed all of it and am thankful that I was able to start my week building in capacity. I liked the free writing, drawing and just being present with myself."""

Californian's are lucky to be surrounded by celebrated regions such as Napa, Sonoma, Calistoga and the Central Coast. With such great wines nearby, its easy to forget a whole world exists outside of California. In this tasting, we will journey to the old world to disciover iconic appellations for fine wine. We will journey to Germany, France, Italy and Spain, as we spotlight each region through a single celebrated winemaker and wine. Discover some of the great origin stories in the world of wine, while Paul details climate, geography, grape variety and winemaking. Immerse yourself in this fun on-your-feet tasting, where education begins in the glass. SERIES DESCRIPTION: 'Through the Glass' are one-of-a-kind wine experiences where history, cuisine and the culture of winemaking are presented together to provide an immersive educational experience. In contrast with classes found at culinary schools, restaurants and wineries, this program reflects a single sommelier working experience with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and American wines. With maps, informational booklets and a curated selection of wines to light the way, Paul leads participants deep into the chosen subject, providing not only wine education but a snapshot of a place and its people.FINE PRINT:- All attendees must be at least 21 years of age.- All sales are final- Participants will receive 1.5 ounce pours from each bottle- The duration of the tasting will be 90-120minHOW TO BOOK1. Follow link to Eventbrite page.  2. Select class, number of tickets and purchase.  3. Recieve welcome email from me, including all details.  4. Receive final confirmation email 24hrs prior to classWHAT TO EXPECT: Tastings begin with a brief rapid-fire presentation on history, geography, climate and soil. Once the stage has been set, I then lead a round-table discussion which includes a sensory evaluation of each wine and information on good service, suggested food pairings and much more. Tastings run between 90-120 minutes in length. Participants will receive a collateral booklet to follow along and make notes. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Classes are designed for all levels of wine experience/education, from newbies to aficionados. There are no ""amateur questions"" and I vigorously protect the opinions of all my attendees. THE VENUE: The Prima Materia tasting room is located at 482 #B, 49th St, Oakland, CA 94609. The venue holds a maximum of 12 participants, seated comfortably on high stools with cushions provided. At the apex of the space will be my perch, surrounded by maps and anything I need to deliver a great wine experience. The room has been outfitted with a modern overhead vent, which provides a steady current of air. Windows along the street-side of the space will remain open for ventilation. Participants are encouraged to wear a comfortable sweater or jacket to combat the draft, until the weather breaks and I can move the tastings outside. That’s right, there is a beautiful outside area I absolutely cannot wait to expand into once the weather turns! THE WINES: Classes will typically feature 7 wines poured in 2-3 flights. Participants will receive a 1.5-2oz pour from each bottle, with a little left over for revisiting. Over the years, I learned the success of a class begins with an above-average selection of wines reflecting the best possible expressions from a given area. This not only includes benchmark wineries, but also smaller producers who are doing amazing things in the vineyard and winery. ABOUT YOUR SOMMELIER: Paul Robinson has been in the hospitality business for over 15 years. His career began in the private event business in NYC, where he led large-scale galas and dinners for Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. After a meaningful trip to Italy, he pursued certification as a sommelier in CA before moving into restaurants full-time. First, for a brief stint in Yountville, then to SF, where he led an extensive wine and cheese program at Chiaroscuro Ristorante. After several years, Paul moved back to NYC to be near family. He poured wine at Del Posto, further deepening his knowledge and appreciation of Italian wines. After departing Del Posto, Paul found a local retail shop/school which would plant the seed for a future business: curating educational deep dives into important regions and appellations all over the wine world. CA beckoned him to return and he has spent the last 3 years running a new business BOTTIVINO.Paul is a certified sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers and a member of the ruling council of the Cavalieri del Tartufo e Dei Vini di Alba - SF Bay Area chapter. He lives in Oakland and pours wines part-time at Ungrafted in SF."

For more information, explore our Accessibility web page.EVENT DESCRIPTIONThe stirrings felt in the ecosystems of mind and heart are mirrored by the shifting tides on a global scale. The planet-sized challenges that are increasingly the norm of our daily lives—climate change, ecosystem disruption, biodiversity loss, rampant social issues—impinge upon the very foundations of human health and the possibility of a viable future. In this scenario, anxiety and dysregulation, along with a long list of mental health issues, are often the blueprint for societal functioning, governed by the myth of endless progress at the expense of a living planet. Yet the Earth serves as the ever-present ground from which psychological resourcing and emotional regulation can emerge.  

CIIS professor in the East West Psychology Department at CIIS and integral ecopsychologist Adrián Villaseñor Galarza and trauma informed psychotherapist Amanda Morrison invite you to slow down and connect with Earth’s living body through a contemplative, eco-therapeutic, trauma-informed approach. Adrián and Amanda’s workshop is immersed in the beautiful garden of Urban Adamah, an educational farm and community center in Berkeley, California.  

Throughout this unique workshop, Adrián and Amanda guide participants in restoring a sense of embodied connection, attentional aliveness, and inner resourcing through a combination of nature reconnection, meditation, group work, and lecture. Participants learn foundational concepts and practices to incorporate into their daily lives or as reference in their contemplative, eco-therapeutic work. 

As the body-mind awakens to its Earthly belonging, a shift from reactivity to resourcefulness is activated, bringing about self-regulation, equanimity, and resilience. Together, we cultivate a more contemplative, resourced engagement with self and world by reformulating our conception of Earth as home, healer, teacher, and self.  Adrián Villaseñor Galarza, PhD, is passionate about human transformation in service of the living Earth. He is Core Faculty in the East West Psychology Department at CIIS and Adjunct Faculty at Naropa University. He has been engaged in transformative education for over 17 years and has offered individual counseling for the last nine, based on a contemplative, eco-systemic, animistic, and transpersonal approach. His work is often considered a Latin American referent when it comes to Nature Reconnection, Ecopsychologies, and Earth-based spirituality. 

Adrián's an integral ecopsychologist, international facilitator, contemplative teacher, author, and ritualist whose work weaves the psycho-spiritual study of the Earth-human relation, animist principles, and contemplative wisdom. He’s the founder and director of the Bioalchemy Institute and the Work That Reconnects Latin America, author of a few books in Spanish and English, editor of the first anthology on the applications of the Work That Reconnects in Latin America, and translator of Joanna Macy’s seminal book, Coming Back to Life: The Updated Guide to the Work That Reconnects.  

The contemplative and Earth-based lineages of beauty, wisdom, and compassion he has honored since his teens serve as the guiding force behind his service toward personal transformation and socio-ecological viability. Amanda Morrison, LMFT, MA, is a trauma informed psychotherapist who weaves Earth wisdom and body awareness to help people recover a deeper sense of connection to themselves and the world around them. For the past decade she has specialized in using ecotherapy to help people heal from early childhood trauma and to find long term recovery from addiction and other mental health issues.  

Amanda graduated from the Somatic Psychotherapy program at California Institute of Integral Studies and has training in various somatic and ecotherapeutic modalities. She is the creator of the Bayside Marin Ecotherapy Program at the dual-diagnosis residential treatment center located in San Rafael, CA. Amanda also worked in the Insight Garden program in San Quentin, where she facilitated ecotherapy groups for incarcerated men serving time in prison. Currently, Amanda has a private practice in San Francisco and in the East Bay where she sees clients both in the office and on the trails of the East Bay Regional Parks.  

In addition to her clinical work, Amanda spent 10 years as an adjunct professor at CIIS, where she taught an experiential ecopsychology course, as well as various other interdisciplinary courses to undergraduate students, with a strong focus on ecopsychology, somatics, and social justice. Her article “Embodying Sentience” was published in the book, Ecotherapy, Healing with Nature in Mind. Amanda is an avid gardener and hiker. Her own daily nature practice keeps her grounded in her body and connected to the land as she navigates these unpredictable but exciting times we are living through.

It is in our nature to tell stories and inform others of our life events. Storytelling is an intrinsic human characteristic. However, the way we communicate with others has changed drastically over time. Storytelling originated with visual stories, such as cave drawings, and then shifted to oral traditions, in which stories were passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. Technology has allowed humans to utilize all forms of storytelling through the years: visual stories in photographs, spoken stories in videos and recordings and written words on blogs and statuses.Throughout history, cultures have honored skilled storytellers and people have used stories to promote cooperation and influence social behaviors. Listening to stories also engages different parts of the brain than data does and engages our emotions. For this show the stories will focus on a theme:  GreenGreen is a color but it conjures up so many other images: Green with envy; Green as the color of money; Green in nature. Turning green when ill. Beng naive. Being green from a climate perspective, or showing your Irish pride. So come on out and see what Green means.  Come tell us your true story of Green. Any way you want to interpret the theme is fine with us.Or just listen and laugh. (Caveat: not all stories may be funny.) Rules: For a chance to tell your true story on the theme, ""Green,"" put your name in the hat.Stories must be true, about you (not someone else), and 5 minutes or less. No notes or reading allowed. We will have a timer to keep you on track. We usually have time for 8 to 10 storytellers.Suggested minimum is $10 per person worth of food or drink purchased at The Sound Room to support our venue sponsor, The Sound Room. Doors open at 5:30.

All levels of experience are welcome. If you don’t have any experience fixing bikes but want to learn, sign up as a novice and we will partner you with an experienced mechanic. It’s a great way to get hands-on learning! We encourage you to talk to clients about what you are fixing and how as well as about the benefits of becoming an SVBC member -- SVBC is key for making biking safer, improving health, and solving climate change. Each mechanic should bring their own lubricants and tools (including a bicycle repair stand if they have one) and if possible their own chair, table, and canopy.Novice Mechanic -- knows how to fix a flat, raise a seat, and adjust caliper brakes. You will be paired with a more experienced mechanic.Intermediate Mechanic -- also knows how to adjust front and rear derailleurs, replace chains & pedals, adjust bearing cones, simple wheel trues, etc., so a bike can pass ABC Quick Check.Advanced Mechanic -- also knows how to repack bearings, replace a spoke, and service pretty much any part on a regular bike (not necessarily everything on every bike -- there is a lot of new technology these days).General Volunteers: Set up the event, take down the event, check-in clients, and hand out snacks.

Please select the add-on if you are comfortable speaking both Spanish and English.League Cycling Instructor: Collect repair tickets, teach ABC Quick Check, do a super quick overview of the LCI Need to Know.How it works: When a client arrives at the registration tent, a Greeter will give them a paper ticket and direct them to one of the mechanics. Clients should keep their tickets during the event because that is how we track them and the number of bikes fixed. The client will arrive at a mechanic station and the mechanic will evaluate what needs to be fixed on the bike with the client’s help. The client should note on their ticket what is fixed. The client should stay with the mechanic as their bike is being fixed. The mechanic will explain what they are doing with the bike. Mechanics will do basic repairs, such as fixing/replacing brakes & cables, fixing flat tires, repairing/replacing chains, adjusting seats, adjusting handlebars, and aligning derailleurs. If a bike requires more complicated repairs or if work takes more than 1 hour, refer the client to a bike shop (Cognitions, Cyclepath, or Zach’s).

The country is literally home to hundreds of them, turning a visit to the shop or wine list into a dizzying experience. Join sommelier Paul as he charts a clear course through Italy’s most important wine appellations, covering Tuscany, Piedmont, Sicily, Campania, Friuli, Alto Adige, and the Veneto. Participants will gain applicable knowledge of the overall geography, climate and some of the most exciting grapes in production today. This is an ideal tasting for those planning a trip to Italy in the near future and want a better idea of what the boot offers!SERIES DESCRIPTION: 'Through the Glass' are one-of-a-kind wine experiences where history, cuisine and the culture of winemaking are presented together to provide an immersive educational experience. In contrast with classes found at culinary schools, restaurants and wineries, this program reflects a single sommelier working experience with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and American wines. With maps, informational booklets and a curated selection of wines to light the way, Paul leads participants deep into the chosen subject, providing not only wine education but a snapshot of a place and its people.FINE PRINT:- All attendees must be at least 21 years of age.- All sales are final- Participants will receive 1.5 ounce pours from each bottle- The duration of the tasting will be 90-120minHOW TO BOOK1. Follow link to Eventbrite page.  2. Select class, number of tickets and purchase.  3. Recieve welcome email from me, including all details.  4. Receive final confirmation email 24hrs prior to classWHAT TO EXPECT: Tastings begin with a brief rapid-fire presentation on history, geography, climate and soil. Once the stage has been set, I then lead a round-table discussion which includes a sensory evaluation of each wine and information on good service, suggested food pairings and much more. Tastings run between 90-120 minutes in length. Participants will receive a collateral booklet to follow along and make notes. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Classes are designed for all levels of wine experience/education, from newbies to aficionados. There are no ""amateur questions"" and I vigorously protect the opinions of all my attendees. THE VENUE: The Prima Materia tasting room is located at 482 #B, 49th St, Oakland, CA 94609. The venue holds a maximum of 12 participants, seated comfortably on high stools with cushions provided. At the apex of the space will be my perch, surrounded by maps and anything I need to deliver a great wine experience. The room has been outfitted with a modern overhead vent, which provides a steady current of air. Windows along the street-side of the space will remain open for ventilation. Participants are encouraged to wear a comfortable sweater or jacket to combat the draft, until the weather breaks and I can move the tastings outside. That’s right, there is a beautiful outside area I absolutely cannot wait to expand into once the weather turns! THE WINES: Classes will typically feature 7 wines poured in 2-3 flights. Participants will receive a 1.5-2oz pour from each bottle, with a little left over for revisiting. Over the years, I learned the success of a class begins with an above-average selection of wines reflecting the best possible expressions from a given area. This not only includes benchmark wineries, but also smaller producers who are doing amazing things in the vineyard and winery. ABOUT YOUR SOMMELIER: Paul Robinson has been in the hospitality business for over 15 years. His career began in the private event business in NYC, where he led large-scale galas and dinners for Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. After a meaningful trip to Italy, he pursued certification as a sommelier in CA before moving into restaurants full-time. First, for a brief stint in Yountville, then to SF, where he led an extensive wine and cheese program at Chiaroscuro Ristorante. After several years, Paul moved back to NYC to be near family. He poured wine at Del Posto, further deepening his knowledge and appreciation of Italian wines. After departing Del Posto, Paul found a local retail shop/school which would plant the seed for a future business: curating educational deep dives into important regions and appellations all over the wine world. CA beckoned him to return and he has spent the last 3 years running a new business BOTTIVINO.Paul is a certified sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers and a member of the ruling council of the Cavalieri del Tartufo e Dei Vini di Alba - SF Bay Area chapter. He lives in Oakland and pours wines part-time at Ungrafted in SF."

Tamera realized that at the core, regenerating trust - especially in the most intimate areas of human life - was the missing key to long-standing cultural and political change.Now, over 40 years later, in an era of rampant climate chaos, a global pandemic, and mounting political unrest - where humanity’s survival into the 22nd century becomes increasingly uncertain - Tamera’s research attempts to provide a regenerative model for a post-capitalist society, rooted into a blueprint for a trust-based life they call “The Sacred Matrix.”THE VILLAGE OF LOVERS is a visionary exploration through the depths of Tamera’s research for the first time. Filmed over eight years with unprecedented access, this documentary will holistically reveal Tamera’s research for the first time, translating the key insights for application in this critical moment of human uncertainty."

The alter-ego of Swiss performance artist, musician and activist Daniel Hellmann, blurs the boundaries between male and female, human and cow, and manages the balancing act between a serious desire to change the world and a humorous sense of lightness. After performing at animal rights and climate protests, international tours in theatres and art festivals, and appearances on TV shows such as The Voice of Germany, the singing drag cow comes to San Francisco for the first time. With emotional songs and surprising storytelling, Soya will immerse you in her fascinating bovine universe that challenges the human self-image as the centre of the universe.For Try Walking in my Hooves, Soya the Cow takes the audience on a philosophical walk through the city. The focus is deliberately on the presence of non-human bodies: dogs walking their friends. Pigeons that have transformed a monument into their toilet. Bodies of killed animals that are carried through the streets by humans as food or clothing. Soya the Cow invites a change of perspective that challenges visual habits and self-image. In a playful and musical way, she calls for a new constitution of the relationship between humans and other animals, based on our common animality.T﻿he event is presented by the Goethe-Institut San Francisco in collaboration with Frameline 47, Swissnex and the Consulate General of Switzerland in San Francisco."

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series.
