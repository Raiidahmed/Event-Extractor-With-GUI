Dr. Marty Bradley, Sustainable Aviation Consultant and Educator, mkbradle@usc.edu. Dr. Bradley is a AIAA Fellow with 39 years of aerospace experience and is now a consultant and educator focused on sustainable aviation. He is an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Practice at USC and teaches AIAA short courses in Sustainable Aviation and Electric Aircraft.
Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:
""Model results indicate that solar geoengineering could offset most climate change...“ – Ken Caldeira, Stanford University, National Academies Workshop June 20, 2023
“An operational SRM [Solar Radiation Modification] deployment is the only known approach that could be deliberately implemented to cool the Earth within a few years” - Bala, Caldeira, et al.

Led by our experienced breathwork facilitator, Yulay Machado.  Relationships play a fundamental role in our lives, but they can be hindered by the scars of abuse and power struggles. It's time to revitalize your connections and heal the wounds that hold you back. In this transformative breathwork workshop, you'll embark on a journey of self-discovery and healing. Through dynamic breathing exercises, you'll release past traumas, shift unhealthy patterns, and cultivate deeper, more authentic bonds.  Embark on a path towards harmonious relationships and a life filled with love and understanding. Whether you're new to breathwork or a seasoned practitioner, all are welcome to join us for this powerful experience. What to Bring:A yoga matWaterWear comfortable clothes (it is an outdoor backyard location, dress accordingly)Avoid eating 30 minutes before BreathworkA journal (optional)Props like a bolster, blankets (optional)About Breathwork:Breathwork is a powerful practice that uses conscious, connected breathing to facilitate deep emotional, physical, and spiritual healing. Through a specific breathing pattern, individuals are able to access altered states of consciousness, release stored trauma and emotions, and tap into their inner wisdom and intuition. This practice is a beautiful tool for self-discovery and growth and has been used for centuries across various spiritual traditions. Breathwork can be done individually or in a group setting and is facilitated by trained practitioners who provide a safe and supportive container for participants to explore and heal.About Yulay:Yulay is a multi-disciplinary holistic therapist having trained in the modalities of ThetaHealing, SACRED ACTIVATIONS, Breathwork, and Integrated Energy Therapy (IET). As a native Colombian, she discovered she had a strong, natural ability to connect with Creator through her ancestral roots and it’s this relationship which allows her to accurately read and shift any situation. Sliding Scale Pricing:The sliding scale model we have chosen for our pricing reflects our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity, embodying the values of equity and community care. It is a beautiful and seamless way for our attendees to align their investment with their current financial reality, honoring both their own journey and the community's journey. We acknowledge that the societal structures we exist within often require means-testing, and we believe that a sliding scale allows for a compassionate and empowering alternative. We trust that those who are able to pay more will do so from a place of generosity and abundance, supporting the sustainability of our events and making it possible for those who need financial support to attend. We invite each person to reflect on their needs and resources and to choose the option that feels most aligned with their values, knowing that each choice contributes to creating a more just and equitable world for all.Nirvana Tier: This reflects the true cost of the class or service. It is the cost that the practitioner would charge all students in the absence of a sliding scale. If you have access to financial security, own property or have personal savings, you would not traditionally qualify for sliding scale services. If you are able to pay for ""wants"" and spend little time worried about securing necessities in your life, you have economic privilege and power in our community. This price is for you.Ascension Tier:This price point is for folks who paying the full cost would prevent them from being able to attend, but who do not honestly find themselves reflected in either descriptions for the highest cost or the lowest. If you are struggling to conquer debt or build savings or move away from paycheck to paycheck living but have access to steady income and are not spending most of your time thinking about meeting basic needs such as food, shelter, medical care, child care, etc., you belong here. If you, however, can ask others for financial support, such as family members, partners, or friends, please consider using those personal resources before you use the resources of the sliding scale and limit opportunities for others.Enchantment Tier: This price point is for folks whose economic circumstances would prevent them from being a part of classes if there was not be a deliberate opportunity made for them to access services at a cost that is reflective of their economic realities. If you struggle to maintain access to needs such as health care, housing, food, child care, and are living paycheck to paycheck or are in significant debt, you belong probably belong here and you deserve a community that honors your price as equal an economic offering as the person who can pay the highest tier. Even when the lower tier is still prohibitive, we will work with folks to offer extended payment plans and other solutions. Please be mindful that if you purchase a price at the lowest end of the scale when you can truthfully afford the higher ticket prices, you are limiting access to those who truly need the gift of financial flexibility. Being honest with yourself and your financial situation when engaging with sliding scale practices grows strong and sustainable communities.Future Offerings:We  host weekly offerings on Thursdays at 7p. Future offerings  include breathwork, cannabis & CBD circles, plant medicine conversations, workshops, community social gatherings, workshops, and much more.These gatherings will be an opportunity to cultivate a sense of community, deepen our spiritual practices, and explore new dimensions of ourselves.Please follow us on instagram @spirituallycuriousco to stay up to date."

Sliding Scale Pricing:The sliding scale model we have chosen for our pricing reflects our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity, embodying the values of equity and community care. It is a beautiful and seamless way for our attendees to align their investment with their current financial reality, honoring both their own journey and the community's journey. We acknowledge that the societal structures we exist within often require means-testing, and we believe that a sliding scale allows for a compassionate and empowering alternative. We trust that those who are able to pay more will do so from a place of generosity and abundance, supporting the sustainability of our events and making it possible for those who need financial support to attend. We invite each person to reflect on their needs and resources and to choose the option that feels most aligned with their values, knowing that each choice contributes to creating a more just and equitable world for all.Nirvana Tier: This reflects the true cost of the class or service. It is the cost that the practitioner would charge all students in the absence of a sliding scale. If you have access to financial security, own property or have personal savings, you would not traditionally qualify for sliding scale services. If you are able to pay for ""wants"" and spend little time worried about securing necessities in your life, you have economic privilege and power in our community. This price is for you.Ascension Tier:This price point is for folks who paying the full cost would prevent them from being able to attend, but who do not honestly find themselves reflected in either descriptions for the highest cost or the lowest. If you are struggling to conquer debt or build savings or move away from paycheck to paycheck living but have access to steady income and are not spending most of your time thinking about meeting basic needs such as food, shelter, medical care, child care, etc., you belong here. If you, however, can ask others for financial support, such as family members, partners, or friends, please consider using those personal resources before you use the resources of the sliding scale and limit opportunities for others.Enchantment Tier: This price point is for folks whose economic circumstances would prevent them from being a part of classes if there was not be a deliberate opportunity made for them to access services at a cost that is reflective of their economic realities. If you struggle to maintain access to needs such as health care, housing, food, child care, and are living paycheck to paycheck or are in significant debt, you belong probably belong here and you deserve a community that honors your price as equal an economic offering as the person who can pay the highest tier. Even when the lower tier is still prohibitive, we will work with folks to offer extended payment plans and other solutions. Please be mindful that if you purchase a price at the lowest end of the scale when you can truthfully afford the higher ticket prices, you are limiting access to those who truly need the gift of financial flexibility. Being honest with yourself and your financial situation when engaging with sliding scale practices grows strong and sustainable communities.Future Offerings:We  host weekly offerings on Thursdays at 6:30p. Future offerings  include breathwork, moon circles, plant medicine conversations, workshops, community social gatherings, workshops, and much more.These gatherings will be an opportunity to cultivate a sense of community, deepen our spiritual practices, and explore new dimensions of ourselves.Please follow us on instagram @spirituallycuriousco to stay up to date."

But what is beyond the horizon, and who has walked this path before? APOLAKI: OPERA OF THE SCORCHED EARTH is a new experimental opera by Filipino-American composer Micaela Tobin in collaboration with installation designer Carlo Maghirang and dancer/choreographer Jay Carlon. Continuing her celebration of the pre-colonial mythologies of the Philippines, Tobin’s new work tells the story of Apolaki, the precolonial God of Sun and War, who finds themself lost in a foreign and unfamiliar land (present day Tongva Land/Los Angeles) after being displaced from the Philippines by Spanish colonizers. This opera is a radical meditation on the complex relationships between settler colonialism, migration, and diaspora, and invites the audience to join Apolaki in this immersive pilgrimage, premiering at the historic and storied Zorthian Ranch overlooking the Los Angeles Basin. This piece is the sequel to Tobin’s recent opera-film, “BAKUNAWA: Opera of the Seven Moons” which premiered at REDCAT in May 2021. Incorporating her signature combination of noise, drone, and opera, for this premiere Tobin has recruited experimental percussionist M.A. Harms and electric bass/guitarist Stephen McNeely to create a dramatic and disruptive soundscape that will draw Apolaki and the audience into a portal for Filipinx Liberation in the form of a  large walking-labyrinth, designed by Carlo Maghirang. APOLAKI is a National Performance Network (NPN) Creation & Development Fund Project co-commissioned by Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in partnership with OUTsider Festival, and NPN. The Creation & Development Fund is supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts (a federal agency). For more information, visit www.npnweb.org. Additional support is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the MAP Fund, supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.About the artistsMicaela Tobin is a soprano, sound artist, and teacher based in Los Angeles, CA who specializes in experimental voice and contemporary opera.As a sound artist with a background in opera, Micaela integrates voice and electronics within the genres of noise and drone music. Her work incorporates ritualized gesture and amplified object-symbolism and explores her diasporic identity as a first-generation Filipina-American. Micaela’s vocal practice is based in building connections between the physical voice as a means of empowering one’s ‘inner’ voice and challenging colonial stories and systems. Composing primarily under the moniker “White Boy Scream,” Micaela dissects her operatic and extended vocal techniques through the use of electronics, oscillating between extreme textures of noise, drone, and operatic sound walls. Her most recent full length album, “BAKUNAWA” (Deathbomb Arc) includes elements of sonic ritual, ancient myth, and ancestral memory. Of the album, Steve Smith of The New Yorker Magazine asserts that “opera would do well to pay attention.” The album was ranked #9 Release of 2020 in The Wire Magazine. In May 2021, Micaela premiered the cinematic adaptation of the album through REDCAT, titled “BAKUNAWA: Opera of the Seven Moons.”As an opera composer, Micaela premiered and earned a five-star review for her first original experimental opera, entitled “Unseal Unseam,” at the world’s largest art festival, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, in summer 2016; the work was described as “hypnotic” and “paralyzingly beautiful,” by New Classic LA after its U.S. debut in October 2017. Her most recent opera, “Belarion: A Space Opera” which premiered at the American Legion Center in Pasadena, CA in February 2019, is about the magickal practices of JPL founder Jack Parsons.As a performer, Micaela played the principal role of Coyote in the critically acclaimed opera, SWEET LAND (dir.

Christy will be in conversation with Katie Dalebout. E﻿vent format: 30 minute chat, followed by audience Q&A and book signingA﻿bout the book:“It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle.” You've probably heard this phrase from any number of people in the wellness space. But as Christy Harrison reveals in her latest book, wellness culture promotes a standard of health that is often both unattainable and deeply harmful.Many people with chronic illness understandably feel dismissed or abandoned by the healthcare system and find solace in alternative medicine, as Harrison once did. Yet the wellness industry promotes practices that often cause even more damage than the conventional approaches they’re meant to replace. From the lack of pre-market safety testing on herbal and dietary supplements, to the unfounded claims made by many wellness influencers and functional-medicine providers, to the social-media algorithms driving users down rabbit holes of wellness mis- and disinformation, it can often feel like no one is looking out for us in the face of the $4.4 trillion global wellness industry.The Wellness Trap delves into the persistent, systemic problems with that industry, offering insight into its troubling pattern of cultural appropriation and its destructive views on mental health, and shedding light on how a growing distrust of conventional medicine has led ordinary people to turn their backs on science. Weaving together history, memoir, reporting, and practical advice, Harrison illuminates the harms of wellness culture while re-imagining our society’s relationship with well-being.A﻿bout the speakers:Christy Harrison, MPH, RD, is a registered dietitian nutritionist, certified intuitive eating counselor, and journalist who has been covering food, nutrition, and health for more than 20 years. She is the author of two books, The Wellness Trap and Anti-Diet, and the producer and host of the podcasts Rethinking Wellness and Food Psych, which have helped tens of thousands of people around the world think critically about diet and wellness culture and develop more peaceful relationships with food. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, SELF, BuzzFeed, Refinery29, Gourmet, Slate, the Food Network, and many other publications, and her work is regularly featured in national print and broadcast media. Learn more about Christy and her work at christyharrison.com.Katie Dalebout is a writer, podcast producer, and host. Her weekly interview show  began in 2013 and now has over 400 episodes. In 2019, she started producing Spiraling, a mental health show she co-hosts. In 2016, she published her book Let It Out, which is about using writing for emotional well-being. She now teaches writing workshops, consults with individuals and brands on creative strategy, and writes a weekly newsletter. She lives in Los Angeles."

We have a moral obligation to house everyone.​Livability: we believe that people should be able to live in pleasant, walkable neighborhoods near jobs, with a high quality of life.Inclusion: we believe that people should be able to find housing that meets their needs at every phase of life, without having to leave their neighborhood.Sustainability: we believe that legalizing walkable urban density to limit sprawl, preserve habitat, reduce car dependency and fossil fuel use, and ensure climate resilience is critical to ensuring the long term health of our planet.Racial justice: we believe that the housing shortage is rooted in a long history of racist practices designed to maintain segregation, and that it is impossible to redress America’s history of systemic racism without addressing housing policy.https://abundanthousingla.org/"

Predominant expressions of land-based art and environmental activism in the US have historically ignored Indigenous and Latinx contributions, and at the same time, acquiring critical reception or scholarly notice has been tied to the whitewashing of cultural signifiers. These artists and activists preserve ancestral adobe and ecological practices to keep its roots within Indigenous heritage while promoting its inclusion to canonical land-based artworks and also promoting its environmental sustainability in the deserts of the Southwest. Through the creation and care of adobe-based art and ecological infrastructure, they are staging interventions against displacement and a loss of cultural memory caused by settler colonialism and other oppressive regimes of power. This MA thesis exhibition charts how these artists use adobe to create physical and imagined homes of resistance, threading within it a subjective narrative through the ancestral lands of First Nation and Mexican people in the southwestern United States, to reorient future scholarship on land-based art and activism toward its ancestral, Indigenous coordinates--those of community belonging and ecological sustainability. It’s also one component of a larger “Mud Kin” ongoing project that will encompass an archive of interviews and photographs and other interventions that express Indigenous placekeeping, as well as an exhibition, a publication, and an ArchGIS mapping tool.Photo Credits: Photo documentation by Tracy Fenix, Antonito, CO during an adobe-making and clay workshop with artist, Joanna Keane Lopez and earthen architect, Ronald Rael, August 2022."
