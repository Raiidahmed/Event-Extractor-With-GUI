E﻿XPERTS & MENTORS (More to be announced)Dr. Troy NachtigallDr Troy Nachtigall is a Designer and Design Researcher exploring the data-material relationship through Fashion and Design.  As a Professor at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and researcher at TU/e, Troy leads research into personalized computational fabrication of clothing, shoes, and accessories. For the Design for Change retreat, Troy will introduce the concept of Systems Thinking and guide participants actively into this way of thinking by collectively playing a designerly game called ‘Loopholes’. The Loopholes game has been collaboratively developed by Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, New Order of Fashion, Elisava University School of Design and Engineering of Barcelona, and other European knowledge partners of the EU Transitions project,.Evey Kwong [futurprimitiv]Evey Kwong is a designer and researcher whose practice evolves in the theme of craft-based technology by connecting with the origin of material cultures, people and place.Her works have been exhibited at the Museum of European Cultures [DE], HOW&WOW BASK IT! [Dutch Design Week] and U-JOINTS: Knots & Knits [Fiskars Biennale, FI]. fueled by her desire to promote crafts making, she collaborates with various institutions on design research projects and workshops. For the Design for Change Retreat, Evey will lead the workshop ‘Connecting Twines’. The earliest twine was made by twisting, untwisting and braiding lengths of plant fiber. Twine is most commonly used in textiles and basketry. The invention of twine is at least as important as the development of stone tools for early humans. Archaeologists have called the development of twine, which can be made stronger and longer than its component fibers, “the string revolution”.Pollyanna MossPollyanna Moss engages in local practices of crafts and explores their inherent narratives. Her work materialises subjective and complex relationships between humans and the environment through design pieces and video installations, which together provide a careful reading of the landscapes she investigates. Through her design practice, Pollyanna develops strong working relationships with multiple parties - co-ordinating and communicating through shared care for the environment, and the species that inhabit various local domains. For the Design for Change Retreat, Pollyanna will be taking participants to the sheep stall in Heeze, near Eindhoven, for an afternoon of grounding and embodied learning experiences about  the local endemic Kempisch Heideschaap. You will see and feel the landscape the sheep regeneratively graze, hear from a local shepherd and work with the precious wool collectively.PRACTICALThe Design for Change Retreat offers a limited number of seats to ensure an intensive, safe and intimate learning environment, where exchange, fee sharing of ideas and open discussion are at the heart of the learning experience.

How much do you think climate change really affects you? 🤔

Or do you not care at all? 🤷

It can be quite difficult to grasp what it truly means that our climate is changing. Actions need to be taken on a global scale to slow down the change and halt it. But during everyday life, nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. 

If you've ever wondered or had doubts about your future because of climate change, this is for you. 

We teamed up with TGD and Green Week TU/e  to create a unique workshop to help you with anxiety or apathy due to climate change.
We'll look at ways of dealing with the stress and pressure you can experience if you are taking action, to avoid burnout!

This workshop is for everyone and all can find something to learn!

To achieve the Dutch policy objective to reduce carbon emissions by 55% in 2030, a shift from fossil towards renewable energy resources is required. Within the Netherlands, geothermal energy is a proven renewable energy resource, but currently only with a limited number of operating installations. Presently producing geothermal projects in the Netherlands are generally located in areas where abundant subsurface data is available.A limiting factor to the broader development of geothermal projects is the fact that the subsurface data in the Netherlands is not well distributed; seismic & well data coverage is poor in roughly half of the country, including major residential and industrial areas with high heat demand. Improving the data coverage in these areas would increase the benefit-risk ratio of geothermal projects. 
In 2017 a framework study was carried out by Energie Beheer Nederland B.V. (EBN) and the TNO Advisory Group for Economic Affairs (TNO-AGE) to identify what data acquisition is required to overcome this data limitation.Subsequently, EBN and TNO-AGE have embarked on a geothermal exploration program (SCAN: ‘Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland’) to acquire additional subsurface data to decrease subsurface uncertainty and hence shape the conditions needed to encourage the development of geothermal projects. This program is government funded through the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate.
The SCAN program is focused on three key activities, namely:
1. The acquisition of regional 2D seismic data
2. The reprocessing of existing 2D seismic data
3. A data well campaign
The acquisition of the new seismic data started with a 2D test line in early 2019, which was carefully analysed to determine the optimum and affordable 2D acquisition parameter for the regional acquisition. The resulting key acquisition parameters were a shot spacing of 60m and a geophone spacing of 5m, using explosives as seismic source. In September 2019 the regional acquisition campaign started and lasted for almost 2.5 years, acquiring a total of 1800 km of 2D seismic and a total of almost 7500 km vintage seismic data is processed. All resulting data is made public free of charge on the SCAN website and the Dutch subsurface portal (NLOG). Based on this newly acquired data, ten search areas have been selected and the first SCAN well is planned to be drilled in 2023.A﻿bout JoahnnesMy name is Johannes van den Akker, I’m 30 years old and live in Amsterdam. I finished the Idea League Geophysics Master in 2018 and after graduating I was not really looking for an office job. I guess I got lucky and I started working for EBN B.V. in 2019 as an acquisition geophysicist. Since then I have been involved in the Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland (SCAN) project, mainly in the field for the acquisition of 2D seismic data. Recently I’ve been working on well development and data acquisition planning for the coming SCAN wells."

Designers and other actors in the production of space play an important role in this and are responsible for developing alternative building practices that help counter these negative trends.On Saturday June 24 we organise a gathering to discuss new roles that architects and urban designers can take up. How can we give shape to a different planning, design culture and construction industry? How can we learn to have positive footprints before a carbon lockdown goes into effect? What does it mean to approach the (built) environment from a perspective of regeneration? What type of architects do we want to be? And how can we do so in a healthy work culture? We want to explore a way of working that goes beyond the competitive model of individual success and soloist genius, towards one of collaboration around socio-ecological ambitions.This work conference marks the end of the 5-year term of Renske van der Stoep and Thijs van Spaandonk as heads of the Masters in Architecture and Urbanism and a celebration of the education programme they introduced, “Design for the Rotterdam Climate Reality”.

Ontwerpers en andere actoren in de productie van de gebouwde omgeving spelen hierin een belangrijke rol en zijn mede verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen van een alternatieve bouwpraktijk die de negatieve tendensen weet om te buigen.Op zaterdag 24 juni gaan we in gesprek over nieuwe rollen die architecten en stedenbouwkundigen kunnen en moeten oppakken. Hoe kunnen we werken aan een andere planologie, ontwerpcultuur en bouwpraktijk? Hoe kunnen we bijvoorbeeld gebouwen een positieve footprint geven en voorkomen dat we in een totale CO2-lockdown terechtkomen? Hoe kunnen we de gebouwde omgeving ontwikkelen op basis van regeneratieve uitgangspunten? Wat voor ontwerpers willen we zijn? En hoe kunnen we een gezonde werkcultuur ontwikkelen?

These limits are to be discovered experientially and experimentally. When so determined these limits are found to be further beliefs to be transcended.’*As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, we are proud to offer visitors the opportunity to personally experience John C. Lilly's tank isolation technique. The original concept was devised by John Lilly as a research instrument in 1954. In the ensuing decades, Lilly would go on to simplify and perfect the solitude, isolation and confinement tank, making it safer to build and use even for those untrained in this kind of research. The floatation tank that is available for visitors to use was inspired by Lilly's original tank designs. The floatation tank is a medium for process. It removes 99% of sensory input sources, assisting the user in cultivating an awareness of their internal state of being and attuning to their senses within and without the tank. Similar to meditation, many people enter into a relationship with sensory deprivation practices with certain expectations about what is going to happen. 'All we can say to these people is — nothing will happen that you don’t already know about; nothing can happen that you will not allow to happen, i.e.: “What is forbidden is not allowed.”' The possibilities for application of the tank isolation technique are multiple, ranging from simple relaxation in the weightlessness of the salt solution, pain relief for individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and psychonautic exploration of consciousness, with many certainly yet to be discovered. The relative lack of contemporary awareness of and research into sensory deprivation is partially due to the inaccessibility of the medium to the public. Floatation centres are scarce and expensive. Especially centres that endeavour to create an environment conducive to exploration, experimentation and reflection are lacking. West hopes to become such an environment throughout the exhibition of the floatation tank, providing an (albeit temporary) embryonic escape through sensory deprivation from life in a cultural climate characterised by flagrant overstimulation. An impossible space for self-interrogation of The Deep Self. * John C. Lilly (1915-2001), The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, (Distributor).What to consider before booking a timeslot You will be in an enclosed space in the absence of light and sound for +/- 1 hour, so if you are claustrophobic or fear the dark this is something to consider. However, as there is no light influx whatsoever in the tank, the inside appears more spacious to the user than it is in reality. This often negates feelings of claustrophobia. Even if you are claustrophobic, please feel free to come give it a try. Your session can be stopped at any time if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. You will be suspended in a solution of Water, Magnesium Sulfate, and Hydrogen peroxide (<100ppm), and Sodium Citrate, maintained around 33-34 degrees Celsius (skin temperature). The solution has a neutral pH, compatible with that of human skin. The solution is filtered and treated between each user.However, if any of the following apply to you, we recommend you do not participate in this installation:You have open wounds anywhere on your body. This includes conditions such as scalp eczema, skin ulcers or athlete’s foot. This if for your own wellbeing (seeing as the highly dense salt solution will sting quite a bit on open or irritated skin) and for the wellbeing of subsequent users of the floatation tank. The same naturally applies to any other infectious diseases.You are currently menstruating, are easily susceptible to urinary tract infections, or are in the process of healing from gender-affirming surgery. If you are pregnant, please consult your physician before booking a session.You suffer from diarrhoea or gastroenteritis/are living with bladder or bowel incontinence.You have low blood pressure.You are epileptic.You are diagnosed with an acute psychological/psychiatric condition. Please consult your respective mental health professional here, do your research and use your best judgement.Any questions about particular conditions’ compatibility (such as specific physical disabilities) with floatation therapy can be directed towards the contact listed at the end of this information sheet. We strongly discourage any visitors from entering the tank under the influence of any and all mind-altering substances (excluding prescription medications taken under the supervision of a medical professional). If the host is under the impression that you are in any way inebriated you will not be allowed inside the tank and your participation fee will not be refunded. The risks of this far outweigh whatever rewards you might have read about. The tank is wheelchair accessible. Please be advised that you will be required to sign a liability waiver before entering the tank.

Midden in deze periode, wordt op maandag 3 juli de lancering van de ‘MoMo spreads Love Movement' gevierd in Amsterdam.De zusterscholen in Nederland ondersteunen hun Keniaanse partnerscholen door de jaarlijkse  ‘MoMo Spreads Love Winter Crowdfunding Actie’. Hiermee kunnen meer specifieke projecten worden bekostigd. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan een schoolbus, een waterput of schoolmeubilair of de aanschaf van meer computers, tablets etcetera.Het netwerk van donateurs, vormt samen met het vrijwilligersnetwerk van de stichting en het scholennetwerk, de lerende netwerkorganisatie Sister Schools.Alleen samen kunnen we de problemen oplossen en vandaar dat we de ‘MoMo Spreads Love Movement’  lanceren.MOMO EDUCATION BY SISTER SCHOOLS FOUNDATIONMoMo Education by Sister Schools Foundation (MoMo) is in 2021 opgericht door documentairemaker Julia Strijland.  MoMo is een digitaal onderwijsprogramma gericht op interculturele samenwerking tussen leerlingen van basis- en middelbare scholen aan weerszijde van de welvaarts balans. Het volledig programma bestaat uit 3 lesblokken van 6 weken per jaar gedurende 2 jaar. Er zijn uitwisselingsmomenten met de docenten voorafgaand aan ieder lesblok. De MoMo Educatie methode maakt gebruik van een veilige online leeromgeving, het Digital Educational Exchange Platform (DEEP). Hier komen de leerlingen samen, wisselen ze foto’s, video’s en ideeën uit en werken ze samen aan projecten, ter verbetering van hun eigen leeromgeving. MoMo stelt  het gezamenlijk belang van kansengelijkheid in het onderwijs voorop. Vanuit betrokkenheid bij dit belang wil MoMo een stuwende en vernieuwende kracht zijn, die bijdraagt aan een duurzame ontwikkeling van de leeromgeving van leerlingen. .Vanuit de gedachte ‘think global, act local’ worden scholen aangemoedigd om crowdfunding acties te houden, komen er campagnes rondom thema’s als ‘Digitale veiligheid’ en krijgen leerlingen een stem op thema’s die belangrijk voor hen zijn, zoals het klimaat, het recht op goed onderwijs en kansengelijkheid . Het overbruggen van verschillen en het communiceren over culturele en sociaal-economische verschillen heen kost tijd. Vandaar dat er een 2-jarig ‘learning by doing’ programma is opgezet, waardoor scholen een duurzame band met elkaar op kunnen bouwen en de relatie daadwerkelijk ondersteuning kan bieden aan de scholen in Kenia.---------MOMO EDUCATION BY SISTER SCHOOLS FOUNDATIONThe Sister Schools Foundation was founded in 2021 by Dutch documentary maker Julia Strijland. The idea of connecting schools on both sides of the wealth divide has been further developed together with Sarah Wanjira, a Kenyan computer teacher. The idea came about when Julia volunteered to teach teachers at a girls' school in Nairobi, St. Elizabeth. A school founded by Mary Mungai. She offers children from the slum an opportunity, shelter and education, which she was only allowed to follow until she was 13.The teachers of this school were very interested in the so-called '21st-century skills' and in digital education, but at the same time they sometimes could not pay the teachers' salaries and/or the children did not come to school because they could not pay for school fees. In short: the school is too poor to invest in digital education. The Kenyan government has introduced a new curriculum, the 'Competency Based Curriculum', which uses digital learning resources, but most schools are unable to offer digital education.That is why the Sister Schools Foundation has been set up in the Netherlands and a TRUST organization has been founded in Kenya. Wilde Ganzen (a Dutch NGO) has supported the Kenyan school projects and the DEEP Kenya Trust.The educational exchange is equivalent; On both ends, children can learn as much from each other. There is no difference. Based on the idea of 'think global, act local', schools are encouraged to hold crowdfunding campaigns, campaigns will be launched on themes such as 'Digital security' and pupils will be given a voice on themes that are important to them, such as the climate, the right to good education and equity. The MoMo Education method uses a secure online learning environment, the Digital Educational Exchange Platform (DEEP). This is where pupils come together, exchange photos, videos and ideas and collaborate on projects to improve their learning environment.Bridging differences and communicating across cultural and socio-economic differences takes time. That is why a 2-year 'learning by doing' program has been set up so that schools can build a lasting bond with each other and the relationship can provide support to the schools in Kenya.CAMPAIGNAfter the May holidays, the foundation starts a campaign to find new Dutch schools to partner with. There is currently room for 11 new schools, both primary (4) and secondary (7). In Kenya, the schools are working hard to get their digital and media skills levels to the right standard to be able to take part in the International exchange starting in September this year. The summer crowdfunding campaign starts officially on Friday, June 16th, the UN Day of the African Child and ends on Nelson Mandela Day, Tuesday, July 18th. In the middle of this period, the launch of the 'MoMo spreads Love Movement' will be celebrated on Monday. July 3rd in Amsterdam.The sister schools in the Netherlands support their Kenyan partner schools through the 'MoMo Spreads Love Winter Crowdfunding Action'. This can be used to fund more specific projects. Consider, for example, a school bus, a well or school furniture or the purchase of more computers, tablets, etc.MoMo SPREADS LOVE MOVEMENTThis network of donors, together with the volunteer network of the foundation and the school network, forms the learning network organization Sister Schools.Only together can we solve deep problems, such as giving access to quality education for all kids worldwide.

Do you trust large organisations to decide how to effectively spend your money, or do you simply hand out cash to individuals and let them spend it where they feel it is most needed?And who decides what the 'best outcome' is? The greatest good for the greatest number of people sounds like a sensible approach for impact on society. But do the needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few, or are there other values and human rights at stake?Kritika Maheshwari is Assistant Professor in Ethics & Philosophy of Technology at the TPM Faculty of TU Delft.

More than 220 million students study at some 23,000 higher education institutions worldwide. Universities are the single most important source of basic research worldwide, while at the same time educating millions for increasingly knowledge-based economies. The higher education enterprise has undergone dramatic and unprecedented change in the past 70 years—going from a relatively small elite sector to educating more than 70 percent of young people in wealthy countries and a third or more in most of the rest of the world. Massification has been the hallmark of higher education worldwide. At the same time, the global knowledge economy depends on universities for research, communication, and education. Higher education has also become more international.Recently, geopolitical tensions, health pandemics and climate change challenge higher education worldwide. In this seminar, we will address the development of international(-ization of) higher education and the implications of geopolitical tensions.  Professor Dr. Philip G.

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals. The School of Life’s drive to spread greater self-awareness and The Humblebrag’s action-oriented courses make for a perfect combination to support the next generations of agenda-setting change-makers.

The day will be opened by the Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy Policy, Rob Jetten, and other speakers include high-level officials of the OECD and the European Commission. There will also be talks and workshops from senior representatives from government and academia. This event marks the conclusion of the EC DG REFORM funded TSI project “Precaution in the Energy Transition and Improved Knowledge for Hydrogen Risk Regulation.” The conference will take place in The Hague on the 5th of July 2023 in the brand-new Amare building and aims at presenting and disseminating main findings and recommendations of the OECD Project. The theme deals with important questions for the success of the energy transition. To successfully carry out the energy transition, inevitable risks that come with it need to be appropriately regulated. How should governments deal with questions of uncertainty, risk and precaution in regulating new energy technologies? This is the main question that will be addressed.  The day will also include practical discussions. For example, how to use recent tools and guidelines and the perspective of local administrators. The morning will be devoted to presentations and a panel discussion which focus on uncertainty in the energy transition with an emphasis on hydrogen risk regulation throughout. The afternoon will be filled with workshops on the following topics: hydrogen risk, precaution and uncertainty, tools for local political governance, risk policy principles, and learning from incidents. Each workshop will be given twice to give participants the opportunity to attend multiple.If you are interested to attend this event, please register for a free ticket on this page.There will be five workshops in the afternoon to go deeper into the issues. Each will be given twice, so you have the opportunity to attend two of them. In the registration form, please inform us of all the workshops you would like to attend, we will allocate them accordingly.Here is a short introduction to the workshops to help you select the ones that interest you most. Learning from IncidentsTransitions, such as the energy transition, require good legislation. Make laws and rules for the long term. Make room for learning, evaluation and experimentation. Dare to question existing systems. In this way, there is more room during implementation to respond quickly to all the new and uncertain aspects that occur in transitions.At the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, the Dutch Council for Public Administration issued an advisory paper on learning in transitions. The advice addresses the question of how learning in transitions is possible, without immediately wanting to cover every risk with new laws and regulations.The Council advises on the basis of principles of good public administration: the rule of law, democracy and administrative capacity. In transitions, things happen unintentionally, so it is necessary to create space for learning, and that sets requirements on public administration. Such as room to make mistakes and learn by trial and error: in other words to stumble and fall, get up again and keep on going.Moderator: Peter Verheij (member Dutch Council for Public Administration)Dutch Risk Policy Principles for the Energy TransitionThe energy transition needs urgent action, but our present system of regulating risk in the Netherlands is not always adequately suited to its innovative character.The Dutch Cabinet will in 2023 present a set of policy principles to deal responsibly with safety and health risks and accelerate the energy transition equally. These principles combine a continuation of good old practices (such as risk and knowledge based approach) with constructive and sound earlier advises, which have not been implemented yet. Additional new elements intend to make the risk approach more compatible with the innovative technologies that come with the energy transition.The risk policy principles, as well as the ideas and discussions surrounding them, will be explained by their developers from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management: Jan van Tol, Jos Benner and Rob Smal.Tools for Local Political governanceAny administrator or public representative who must make decisions about new projects for the energy transition will be familiar with this dilemma: the energy transition is necessary due to, among other things, the significant risk of climate change. But inevitably, as with any human activity, new technology will also introduce new risks. How do we decide what new risks are acceptable and which approach to the precautionary principle is suitable? A group of Dutch mayors, aldermen and provincial authorities, the working group for a safe energy transition (Bestuurlijk Overleg voor een Veilige Energietransitie in Nederland, BOVEN) believes that integral decision making is the way forward. This means taking both the positive and the negative risks of new technology into the equation. As an aid by that effort a new tool for local decision makers has been developed, the “risk mixing console”. This enables the comparison of existing and new safety and health risks using as common denominator the WHO disability adjusted life year (DALY).In this workshop the challenge for local authorities and the use of the risk mixing console will be discussed. Moderator: Ira Helsloot (professor Governance of Safety and Security, Radboud University)Hydrogen Risk RegulationThis work centres around dealing with risk uncertainty when adopting a new technology, hydrogen as a common based fuel and energy source, where there is an absence of agreed and shared understanding of the hazards and risks – even when the benefits of this technology are accepted. In response to global energy pressures and the urgent need to tackle climate many governments have set out ambitious energy transition policies and plans but delivering these changes into local communities has become a challenge in the light of uncertainty about the risks. The workshop will explore the dynamics of risk based regulation and societal acceptance of these new technologies.Moderator: Ian TraversUncertainty and Precaution in the Energy TransitionInformation to follow, check back soon."

It will take place 6-7 July 2023 in Amsterdam.  DescriptionThe VSR, the Dutch and Flemish Law and Society association, has existed since 1980 and is an association for researchers and practicing lawyers who themselves conduct research in the field of the empirical workings of law or are interested in it. During our annual two-day conference researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (sociologists of law, legal anthropologists, legal psychologists, public administration experts and criminologists) present their findings. See the VSR website for more details about its structure and goals.The theme for this year's Annual Conference is: The Next Generation.Society as a whole is faced with challenges on how to move further and how to ensure the next generation can thrive. Topics such as the climate crisis, migration, democratic backsliding, the role of technology are just a few of the pressing issues we are faced with. The Next Generation also means pushing boundaries, employing different approaches and creating space for junior academics and those voices in academia who do not always get the same space. All themes will be running throughout the whole conference. Our keynote speaker pushes boundaries with her approach to research, we want to connect scholars who have something to offer and those who seek help via Academic Speed Dating and create space for voices in academia who do not always get the same platform as others.There will be a conference fee to pay for food and drinks (tea and coffee, lunch and one reception with snacks included) during the conference. As a participant you can sign up for the conference dinner as well.
