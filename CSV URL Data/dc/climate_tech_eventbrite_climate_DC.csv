Please visit us during those hours or call 804-447-8189.Iris DeMentWebsite | Facebook | Instagram | Twitter On her transcendent new record, Workin' On A World, Iris DeMent faces the modern world — as it is right now — with its climate catastrophe, pandemic illness, and epidemic of violence and social injustice — and not only asks us how we can keep working towards a better world, but implores us to love each other, despite our very different ways of seeing. Her songs are her way of healing our broken inner and outer spaces. With an inimitable voice as John Prine described, ""like you've heard, but not really,""  and unforgettable melodies rooted in hymns, gospel, and old country music, she's simply one of the finest singer-songwriters in America as well as one of our fiercest advocates for human rights. Her debut record Infamous Angel, which just celebrated its 30th anniversary, was recently named one of the “greatest country albums of all time” by Rolling Stone, and the two albums that followed, My Life and The Way I Should, were both nominated for GRAMMYs. From there, DeMent released three records on her own label, Flariella Records, the most recent of which, The Trackless Woods (2015), was hailed as “a quietly powerful triumph” by The Guardian. DeMent’s songs have also been featured in film (True Grit) and television (The Leftovers) and recorded by numerous artists. Fittingly, she received the Americana Music Trailblazer Award in 2017. Workin' On A World, her seventh album, started with the worry that woke DeMent up after the 2016 elections: how can we survive this?  “Every day some new trauma was being added to the old ones that kept repeating themselves, and like everybody else, I was just trying to bear up under it all,” she recalls. She returned to a truth she had known since childhood: music is medicine. “My mom always had a way of finding the song that would prove equal to whatever situation we were facing. Throughout my life, songs have been lending me a hand. Writing songs, singing songs, putting them on records, has been a way for me to extend that hand to others.” With grace, courage, and soul, Iris shares 13 anthems — love songs, really — to and for our broken inner and outer worlds. DeMent sets the stage for the album with the title track in which she moves from a sense of despair towards a place of promise. “Now I’m workin’ on a world I may never see / Joinin’ forces with the warriors of love / Who came before and will follow you and me.” She summons various social justice warriors, both past and present, to deliver messages of optimism. “How Long” references Martin Luther King, while “Warriors of Love” includes John Lewis and Rachel Corrie. “Goin’ Down To Sing in Texas” is an ode not only to gun control, but also to the brave folks who speak out against tyranny and endure the consequences in an unjust world. “I kept hearing a lot of talk about the arc of history that Dr. King so famously said bends towards justice,” she recalls. “I was having my doubts. But, then it dawned on me, he never said the arc would magically bend itself. Songs, over the course of history, have proven to be pretty good arc benders.” Bending inward, DeMent reaches agilely under the slippery surface of politics. She grapples with loss on the deeply honest “I Won’t Ask You Why,” while encouraging compassion over hate in the awe-inspiring “Say A Good Word.”  Album closer “Waycross, Georgia,” encompasses the end of the journey, thanking those along the way.  As she approaches subjects of aging, loss, suicide, and service, an arc of compassion elevated to something far beyond words is transmitted.  The delicate fierceness encompassed in the riveting power of her voice has somehow only grown over time. Stalled partway through by the pandemic, the record took six years to make with the help of three friends and co-producers: Richard Bennett, Pieta Brown, and Jim Rooney. It was Pieta Brown who gave the record its final push. “Pieta asked me what had come of the recordings I’d done with Jim and Richard in 2019 and 2020. I told her I’d pretty much given up on trying to make a record. She asked would I mind if she had a listen. So, I had everything we’d done sent over to her, and not long after that I got a text, bouncing with exclamation marks: ‘You have a record and it’s called Workin’ On A World!’” With Bennett back in the studio with them, Brown and DeMent recorded several more songs and put the final touches on the record in Nashville in April of 2022. The result is a hopeful album — shimmering with brilliant flashes of poignant humor and uplifting tenderness — that speaks the truth, “in the way that truth is always hopeful,” she explains.  Reflecting on the lyrics of the song “The Sacred Now” (“see these walls/ let’s bring ‘em on down / it’s not a dream; it’s the sacred now”), DeMent is reminded of Jesus saying the Kingdom of God is within you and the Buddhist activist monk Thich Nhat Hanh saying the rose is in the compost; the compost is in the rose. On Workin’ On A World, Iris DeMent demonstrates that songs are the healing and the healing arises through songAna EggeWebsite | Facebook | Instagram | Twitter “Ana is the folk Nina Simone.” – Lucinda WilliamsWhen conceiving Between Us, Ana Egge knew she wanted to do something new and different for her 12th album. The process started early in the pandemic, when she began collaborating online with Irish singer-songwriter Mick Flannery, whose path she had crossed at festivals over the years. They would FaceTime regularly for two-hour songwriting sessions. “It was so fun, and the writing happened so easily,” says Egge. “Almost every time we’d meet up, we would write a whole song.”Searching for a producer with a fresh sonic direction to bring these brilliant, thought-provoking songs to life, Egge met with Lorenzo Wolff after being fascinated by his work on the recent Judee Sill tribute Down Where the Valleys Are Low. They quickly found a common wavelength on how to approach her music. “She was interested in making a big, messy record that reinforced the message of this beautiful collection of songs,” Wolff explains. “I was able to make sonic choices in a very deliberate way to reinforce what she was already saying so eloquently in the songs. And since Ana has such adventurous ears, she would not only be accepting of this landscape, but push the arrangements into even more ambitious territory.”While Egge has long written insightfully about relationships, the stressful, ominous feelings caused by the pandemic and social unrest led her to take a “let’s get to the truth — let’s do that right now” attitude with her songwriting. On tracks like “Sorry,” “You Hurt Me,” “We Let the Devil,” and “Heartbroken Kind,” she delves into the complexities of troubled relationships — no one is free of blame; everyone has the ability to take some accountability for their actions — as well as the ways “to have some type of bridge between the space between us.”“Lie, Lie, Lie” and “We Lay Roses” were so personal to Egge that she felt compelled to include them on Between Us. “Lie, Lie, Lie,” the one song she wrote solo, addresses the frequently impossible attempt to make a loved one break out of his judgmental intolerances and hateful behavior. Egge wrote “We Lay Roses” with Grammy-winner Gary Nicholson as a eulogy for her nephew; she hopes it can help people in grief “who are looking for a song about honoring someone and letting them go.”The players Egge and Wolff assembled were all people she had never played with before (except for backing vocalist J. Hoard) and they brought eclectic musical backgrounds to the music. Corey Fonville, who told Wolff that “no one ever calls me to play on this kind of stuff,” plays drums with Charlie Hunter and is a founding member of the group Butcher Brown. Bassist Michael Isvara Montgomery and guitarist/steel guitarist Jonny Lam are part of the African psych-funk outfit Sinkane. Egge had seen flautist Anh Phung performing in a bluegrass band. New Orleans-schooled keyboardist Jon Cowherd has a long association with Brian Blades (Joshua Redman, Daniel Lanois, Joni Mitchell), while the horn players’ credits range from Ricky Martin to Rhiannon Giddens.Wolff (who also plays on the album) and Egge gave the musicians a lot of free reign. “It was really fun to hear the sounds that they came up with.” The percussion/drum-like sound on “You Hurt Me,” for instance, was actually played by Anh Phung on the flute. And the whimsical sound effects in the groove-heavy “Want Your Attention” were created by Egge’s seven-year-old daughter singing through a $19 echo microphone.Egge acknowledges Between Us won’t help those trying to categorize her music; however, the album does connect to her prior work. Synths and horns, for example, also were used on White Tiger and Is It the Kiss, although acoustic instruments are less prominent on Between Us. Egge remembers how much she has always loved Emmylou Harris’ Wrecking Ball and that groundbreaking album (which also features Cowherd’s frequent collaborator Blades on drums) provides some genre-splitting context for Between Us. “Synthesizers were one of the first things I heard, along with Willie Nelson and Bob Marley,” Egge elaborates. “It’s all totally natural and part of the air that I breathe just as much as pedal steel is. Even though some people might not call it organic, it really is to me.”Egge burst onto the music scene with her debut album, 1997’s River Under the Road, which All Music noted “signals the arrival of a unique songwriting perspective and moving new voice.” She was named “Best Singer Songwriter” and “Best Folk Artist” the following year at the Austin Music Awards. Since then, Egge has consistently garnered critical praise for her music, and has worked with producers Steve Earle, Joel Plaskett, Alec Spiegelman, and Stewart Lerman and recorded with Billy Strings, Anais Mitchell and Iris DeMent. Her songs have been licensed for TV shows on MTV and Showtime and recorded by other influential roots musicians like Dave Alvin, Laurie Lewis and Slaid Cleaves. No Depression hailed her 2017 release, White Tiger, as “nothing less than a balm for the soul” and Folk Alleyproclaimed that 2019’s Is It the Kiss brought “great, honest songs to the collective consciousness.”In the first months of 2021, Ana released a virtual two-sided single, Side A- “This Time,” which Rufus Wainwright described as “beautiful” and Anais Mitchell called “Perfect!!! Incredible,” and Side B- “The Ship,” which, in the words of American Songwriter, “speaks quietly but defiantly of a simmering revolution brewing in the world today, reconciled only by an understanding that working together achieves a harmonious goal.”"

We also recommend that attendees wear solid work shoes and bring gloves if possible.- If you would like to sit during the event, please bring your own chairs. Otherwise, participants may stand or sit on the ground.About UsWhen Lancaster Compost Co-Ops was started in April 2021, Lancaster residents had zero alternatives to divert organic food and garden scraps from the general waste stream beyond individual backyards. Composting is a mainstream activity in American cities – and we believed it was high time for Lancaster to address the existing community interest.LCC currently has several co-op sites in Lancaster City. Each site has a critter proof and smell proof compost bin in a public space that allows trained community members to create high quality compost. A local community member, or ""captain,"" independently runs the site with the support of the community participants.To learn more, check out our website (www.lancastercompost.us) or Instagram (LancasterCompost).

A﻿lex El Dahdah's “Āh” Short Film Screening + DiscussionS﻿aturday, May 13, 7pm @ The ParlorWatch the short film Āh (2020) by Alex El Dahdah and delve into the struggles and challenges historically faced by many gay and queer Asians. Consider how these issues have served as catalysts for hate crimes, forced immigration/displacement, and trauma that persists today. The film thoughtfully examines the nuances of experience, exploring intersections with family dynamics, class, and instances of sublimation and repression. It also highlights a single love encounter's profound impact on a family when it conflicts with established traditions. While many of these challenges are not exclusive to sexuality or gender, their occurrence can amplify the problem. In Āh, Malek, a scion of a Lebanese feudal family, endeavors to preserve his homosexual relationship amid the matriarch's disapproval. Her opposition drives him toward sublimation, ultimately leading to the sacrifice of his lover as collateral damage. This shatters a symbol of love and stability, fracturing Malek's sense of self.Three Patterns Exhibition Saturday, May 20-Sunday, May 21 @ The BankGallery Hours: Saturday, May 20,  6:30-10:30pmSunday, May 21, 1 – 5pmTICKETS (REQUIRED): https://Threepatterns.eventbrite.comPresented by OTS Productions ""Three Patterns"" is divided into three stories: “Possessed”, “The Sacred Hex”, and “Hellbond”, which include themes of Suffering, Ritual, and Spirituality.

Jocelyn and Megan’s careers in the wine industry converged at a small Italian inspired winery in southwestern Virginia. Their vision in 2021 grew from grapes without a home, a winery with space available, and meraki- a Greek word for doing something with soul, creativity, or love; to leave a piece of yourself in your work. Jocelyn and Megan are part of a new generation of winemakers and wine brands who see an opportunity to continue to transform the typical archetype of a male owned and operated wine business. They are standing on shoulders of women who blazed a trail in the Virginia wine and cider industries and, with the launch of Daring Wine Company, Jocelyn and Megan are continuing to shape their own future in this industry. They started with two single vineyard wines, a Chardonnay and a Barbera, grown from grapes at Stanburn Vineyard Inc., and a dry cider produced from a blend of cider apples grown in central Virginia. Heron Hill WineryHeron Hill has been producing delicious cool-climate wines from the Finger Lakes for nearly 50 years.  They make outstanding riesling, chardonnay, blaufrankish, pinots, and more.  So why include them in a Northern Virginia wine geek Bar Takeover?  We think you know why.  Their winemaker, Jordan Harris, did wonderful things at Tarara Winery in Northern Virginia for nearly a decade, and his winemaking left an impression on the Walsh team.  This is our excuse to get him back in the building.  Join Jordan as he walks us through what he has been working on in the Finger Lakes, contrasting our warm-climate wines with what he is working on up North.  Always a blast and a great source of winemaking knowledge, we are thrillled to have confinced him to join us for his first Bar Takeover$25 / tasting ($20 in advance)Wines will be available for purchase while supplies last."

Understanding the importance of this goal and addressing the climate challenges before us, PEC staff will share how our work encourages policies, zoning, and individual actions that help reduce power demand and emissions, capture and sequester carbon in our forests and soils, and promote distributed renewable energy options. To add to the challenge, the proliferation of high energy use data centers is shifting the goalpost and making the VCEA goals all that much more difficult to meet. While the growth of data centers within the major data center hub of northern Virginia continues at a fast pace, communities throughout Virginia are now starting to see more proposals for data centers.Agenda9:30 a.m. | Check-in/Meet & Greet10:00 a.m. | Welcome & PEC Update from John McCarthy, Senior Advisor & Director of Strategic Partnerships10:30 a.m. | Keynote Address by Dr. Maime Parker: “The Passion, Inspiration, and Excellence (PIE) in Collaboration""12:00 p.m. | Community Lunch with Local Ingredients (sponsored by Country Chevy)1:00 p.m. | Workshops 2﻿:30 p.m. | DepartThank you to our generous sponsors!C﻿ountry ChevroletP﻿low & Hearth"

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

Initially a duo making covers on YouTube during quarantine, Keep Your Secrets evolved into a full band making original music in the summer of 2021, and started building a name for themselves in the DC area alternative music scene. They call their sound ""Cold Brew Core,"" for the monster-drinking warped tour kids who have grown into highly caffeinated adults. Despite their catchy hooks and major-key pop punk sound, Keep Your Secrets’ new EP it's all good explores weighty topics like heartbreak, betrayal, mental illness, structural racism, and climate grief.

Consisting of Estelle Angel (vocals), Thomas Shreve (drums), Tom Fisher (bass), Xela Stockmal and Adam Padilla (guitars), ALR’s scrappy early EPs and dedication to frequent and intense live shows across the East Coast and Midwest earned them attention from national publications including The Alternative and No Echo. Their debut LP “Blooming” in July 2022, the group have developed a sound all their own that often fluctuates violently between the beautiful and the ugly; a theme that remains constant across all aspects of their presentation.Music | Instagram | Facebook | TwitterH﻿ungry BugHungry Bug is a band from the DMV area making their way through the garage punk genre.

We will read a mix of non-fiction, novels, essays, speculative fiction, sci-fi and graphic novels that provide a diverse lens on the people, places, and spaces that are affected by our changing climate. This book club is hosted by Jess Schreibstein. Jess just finished a graduate degree in Sustainability from Harvard at the end of 2022 and served as Communications Lead of our local Sunrise Movement chapter during the 2020 election cycle. She has been hosting this book club virtually since 2020 and is excited to bring an in-person version to her favorite local bookstore!The first book is Healing Grounds by Liz Carlisle. About HEALING GROUNDS:A powerful movement is happening in farming today—farmers are reconnecting with their roots to fight climate change. For one woman, that’s meant learning her tribe’s history to help bring back the buffalo. For another, it’s meant preserving forest purchased by her great-great-uncle, among the first wave of African Americans to buy land. Others are rejecting monoculture to grow corn, beans, and squash the way farmers in Mexico have done for centuries. Still others are rotating crops for the native cuisines of those who fled the “American wars” in Southeast Asia.In Healing Grounds, Liz Carlisle tells the stories of Indigenous, Black, Latinx, and Asian American farmers who are reviving their ancestors’ methods of growing food—techniques long suppressed by the industrial food system. These farmers are restoring native prairies, nurturing beneficial fungi, and enriching soil health. While feeding their communities and revitalizing cultural ties to land, they are steadily stitching ecosystems back together and repairing the natural carbon cycle. This, Carlisle shows, is the true regenerative agriculture – not merely a set of technical tricks for storing CO2 in the ground, but a holistic approach that values diversity in both plants and people.Cultivating this kind of regenerative farming will require reckoning with our nation’s agricultural history—a history marked by discrimination and displacement. And it will ultimately require dismantling power structures that have blocked many farmers of color from owning land or building wealth. The task is great, but so is its promise. By coming together to restore these farmlands, we can not only heal our planet, we can heal our communities and ourselves.Healing Grounds is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

The evening includes a complimentary dinner catering/drinks and screening of the film, followed by a thoughtful discussion with a panel of the filmmakers and experts.P﻿anel: Adam Andrzejewski, Jeff Selingo. Moderator: Director Ginger Gentile.About the film: EXCLUSION U looks at the real scandal in higher education: How Ivy League Universities hoard billions while refusing to expand enrollments. These tax-exempt institutions are failing their mission to act in the public good. Interviews with low income students  deans of admissions, and shocking financial information force the question: why do we continue to invest so much in institutions that invest so little back in us?When: Tuesday, June 6th, 6:30-8:30 pm (check-in by 6:20 pm)Where: Regal Gallery Place, 701 7th St NW, Third Floor, Washington, DC 20001Admission: Free, with reservation only.

Email ExclusionU@gmail.comFor more info about the film, visit ExclusionU.com-------------------﻿Learn more about the film: EXCLUSION U asks if Ivy League Universities are expanding educational opportunities or limiting them, despite their endowment growing by billions of dollars each year. Admission to an Ivy League university is the ultimate prize for low income students, as it promises to propel them to wealth while receiving a full ride. But what is the value of this prize if too few students obtain it?Using a combination of financial investigation and heartbreaking interviews with low-income students, the true purpose of holistic admissions is revealed: to give an advantage to wealthy and connected students. By keeping admissions numbers low by driving up demand and not expanding class size, these colleges create a perverse incentive to donate more and more money to secure a spot. This cycle continues as donations grow tax-free in endowments that are never spent.EXCLUSION U challenges the notion that these are “private schools” as they receive subsidies at a higher rate than state schools that educate needier students. Why does the United States allow these schools to hoard wealth while giving such little return on our collective investment? Why are we the only country in the world to use legacy admission? Do the communities in which these universities call home benefit from their presence or are they living in the shadow of the ivory tower?The film ends on a call to action, as other universities public and private show the ivies how they can be elite, without being elitist. EXCLUSION U is a wake up call for any student who dreams of attending an ivy and for anyone who cares about our democracy.

It’s a frightening tale of a society that failed to protect its vulnerable.

Each camp’s story is printed on exquisite rice paper which is interwoven with dramatic landscapes. The design captures the multilayered feelings of anger, vulnerability, determination, cultural pride, and shared grief of those who lived in these camps. The book also contains an essay by Dr. Donna Nagata, Professor of Psychology at University of Michigan, who has conducted important research on the multigenerational consequences of the race-based incarceration of Japanese Americans. Today’s fragile and disturbing climate of  intolerance makes it all the more urgent that this period of our history not be forgotten.

Sandy and Catiana are joining us on the Busboys stage to share their experience photographing the horrors of Japanese Americans during World War 2. Copies of the book will be available for purchase during and after the event, and the authors will be signing following the program.
This event is free and open to all. Our program begins at 6:00 pm, and will be followed by an audience Q&A. Copies of SHOW ME THE WAY TO GO TO HOME will be available for purchase before and after] the event. Please note that this event is IN PERSON and will NOT be livestreamed. 
We ask that guests RSVP in order to receive direct updates about the event from Busboys and Poets Books

Sandy Sugawara is a Maryland-based photographer and journalist. After the death of her parents, Sandy turned her attention West, focusing on themes of family and memories through landscape. She has been photographing the incarceration facilities where Japanese Americans, including her mom and dad, were locked up during World War 2, capturing the sadness, pain, hope, strength and the range of other emotions present at these sites. Her photographs are held in public and private collections, and her work has appeared in a number of juried exhibitions around the country.

Catiana Garcia-Kilroy is a DC based photographer and development economist. In her photography she seeks to recreate the experience of place, whether it is through single images of overlooked details or places, or in more elaborated narratives, linking landscape to the memory of personal stories and historical events.  In addition to her work on Show Me the Way to Go to Home, she is also working with Sandy on a project about the Crystal City Enemy Detention Facility, where descendants of nationals from the Axis nations, kidnapped by the US Government from Latin American countries, were detained for a prisoner exchange program."

""Show Me the Way to Go to Home"" is an immersive, visual journey through the incarceration camps that held 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War 2. Photographers Sandy Sugawara and Catiana Garcia Kilroy tell the story of each camp through original and archival photographs, personal stories, and government documents. It’s a frightening tale of a society that failed to protect its vulnerable.Each camp’s story is printed on exquisite rice paper which is interwoven with dramatic landscapes. The design captures the multilayered feelings of anger, vulnerability, determination, cultural pride, and shared grief of those who lived in these camps. Today’s fragile and disturbing climate of  intolerance makes it all the more urgent that this period of our history not be forgotten.The book also contains poetry by Brandon Shimoda and Christine Kitano, a foreword by civil rights advocate Dr. Karen Korematsu, and an essay by Dr. Donna Nagata, who has conducted important research on the multigenerational consequences of the race-based incarceration of Japanese Americans. https://www.radiusbooks.org/all-books/p/sandy-sugawara-and-catiana-garcia-kilroy-show-me-the-way-to-go-to-home"

ABOUT ICE: Ice is everywhere: in gas stations, in restaurants, in hospitals, in our homes. Americans think nothing of dropping a few ice cubes into tall glasses of tea to ward off the heat of a hot summer day. Most refrigerators owned by Americans feature automatic ice machines. Ice on-demand has so revolutionized modern life that it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t always this way—and to overlook what aspects of society might just melt away as the planet warms.In Ice, journalist and historian Amy Brady shares the strange and storied two-hundred-year-old history of ice in America: from the introduction of mixed drinks “on the rocks,” to the nation’s first-ever indoor ice rink, to how delicacies like ice creams and iced tea revolutionized our palates, to the ubiquitous ice machine in every motel across the US. But Ice doesn’t end in the past. Brady also explores the surprising present-day uses of ice in sports, medicine, and sustainable energy—including cutting-edge cryotherapy breast-cancer treatments and new refrigerator technologies that may prove to be more energy efficient—underscoring how precious this commodity is, especially in an age of climate change.The unexpected and unexplored ways that ice has transformed a nation—from the foods Americans eat, to the sports they play, to the way they live today—and what its future might look like on a swiftly warming planet.About Amy Brady:Amy Brady is the executive director of Orion magazine and coeditor of The World as We Knew It: Dispatches from a Changing Climate.

As the Earls Community grew in size and closeness we came in contact with the reality that many of our supports, volunteers and guest were facing immediate housing and economic crisis. As we noticed a demand from a growing population of homeless citizens our leader Reginald Guy Decided to encourage the earl community to start and operate a non-profit that meets the needs of the people. Thus, The Purpose Party Was Created. In providing free food, water, clothing, and hygiene products for citizens and residents in the communities we are removing socio-physical barriers to civic engagement. In removing the following socio-physical barriers to civic engagement such as: lack of; essential hygienic products, adequate: nutrition, hydration, civic education, shelter, first-aid, and climate protection, we enable citizens and residents to be secure in engaging one another in a equitable and just manner that fosters self-respect, community togetherness, and civic engagement. Once we have addressed and defeated these pressing issues that provide barriers to civic engagement; we then create forums from which we begin to develop the community literacy,  and tackle other root issues that lead to the need for freedom fighters such as ourselves."
