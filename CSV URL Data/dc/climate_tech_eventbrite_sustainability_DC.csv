Social isolation is an objective lack of social relationships or infrequency of social contact. Loneliness is a subjective feeling of isolation. A person can be socially isolated but not feel lonely. A person can also feel lonely when they are surrounded by people.  Nonetheless, isolation and loneliness are very much linked. Studies of loneliness’s causes, symptoms, and impacts shed light on the potential negative effects of social isolation.SOLUTION:  Let's come together to break bread, fellowship, and establish/cultivate relationships!"

This summer, Sustainability Matters is seeking volunteers for environmental data collection and community education. Join us on Saturday, June 17 for a morning of volunteer training at the Rappahannock County landfill, one of the sites for Sustainability Matters’ Making Trash Bloom project. From 10am-1pm, Sustainability Matters staff will train volunteers on how to collect data about native and invasive plants, as well as provide more information about future volunteer opportunities at the site this summer. Sustainability Matters’ Making Trash Bloom initiative reclaims ecologically barren land by planting native pollinator and wildlife habitat at landfills. Through bringing conservation to the most unexpected place of all - your local dump - we build community engagement around environmental transformation, inspiring and educating the public to create similar landscapes at home and elsewhere. Summer volunteer activities include: ""Sustainable Science Team"": data collection on native and invasive plants""Docents at the Dump"":  educate community members on the importance of native plants by leading guided tours of the Rappahannock County MTB siteNote that the event will be held entirely outdoors. We will be walking through tall grass, so please dress accordingly.Making Trash Bloom is geared at planting trash cells with bee and butterfly friendly native wildflower meadows. When landfills seal 5-10 acre trash cells, that land can never be built on, used to grow crops, or planted with trees. Landfills currently seed trash cells with turfgrass, which has no environmental value. Sustainability Matters is partnering with the Rappahannock County Landfill to plant pollinator and wildlife habitat instead. The pilot plot/demonstration garden was planted  in October 2022, and we are eager to see what's blooming this summer. To learn more about our Making Trash Bloom Initiative, feel free to watch the video below.  When you register for this program, we'll also sign you up for Sustainability Matters' email list. We never sell your info, and you may unsubscribe at any time. For more information, contact: kenny@sustainabilitymatters.earth"

The philanthropic and business communities are targeting resources in the name of creating equity and improving outcomes for all groups. From corporations and nonprofits to universities and government agencies, many entities have constructed outward-facing equity statements and have directed management to lead the charge of achieving equity. However, frustration remains for those who are on the front lines working to disrupt and dismantle inequities within public health, education, housing, and workforce systems. To this end, Iona Concepts, Inc. has created a menu of Transformational Learning Circles. These sessions are designed to incorporate the voices of those who are at the forefront of this work and responsible for creating and implementing practices that move the needle of change toward progress. These collaborative convenings are iterative and build on the collective experiences of our Brain Trust, a cadre of seasoned practitioners who center liberatory practices and have a track record of executing models that are disrupting structural inequities and violence in organizational systems and communities. Transformational Learning Circles are curated for participants who aim to learn about and achieve sustainable and transferable practices that advance racial justice and healing inside and outside organizational systems and communities. Sessions are held at Baltimore Unity Hall 1505 Eutaw Place, Baltimore, MD 21217 at no cost, yet monetary donations are welcomed. We encourage Baltimore City’s social and public health organizations, social entrepreneurs,  educators, students, and researchers to join us. At the completion of each circle, p﻿articipants will receive a certificate of completion. For registration, we require the completion of this surveyT﻿o get in contact with our team, please reach us at: admin@livewellbemore.comTransformational Learning CirclesConducting Race Equity Audits and BenchmarksThursday, 5/22/23, 1 - 4 pm (date change from original 5/18/22)Funders are tying strings to connect resources by requesting that providers create equity strategies and benchmarks. This process begins with auditing policies, practices, and operational systems. Collecting information for analysis requires a multi-prong approach of reviewing pre-existing data, including the origin story of the institution, human resources data, and conducting key informant surveys and interviews.  This session will explore how this process can create organizational “white water” by triggering racial trauma for people of color and uncovering unconscious biases of supervisors and co-workers. Participants will learn:- Key indicators to facilitate an analysis that focuses on measuring the impact of REDI audits and benchmarking - Learn key strategies to navigate the turbulence of uncovering disparities that are often baked into organizational cultureWhen Race, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (REDI) Create PTSDThursday, 6/15/23, 1- 4 pmPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hidden condition that can be triggered by ongoing experiences with microaggression, discrimination, and retaliation for speaking up and out about inequitable policies, practices, and culture that undermines people who experience discrimination due to class, disability, educational/employment status, ethnicity, gender expression or identity, national origin, race and sexual orientation individually or with intersectionality. This condition can also be triggered when frontline REDI practitioners constantly experience covert, uninformed, and performative efforts without a real destination or plan of action.  This session will explore how Courageous Conversations designed to uncover workplace biases are often fatiguing and can trigger workplace PTSD. Participants will learn how to recognize the conditions of a toxic work environment and learn strategies to support and implement mindfulness within organizational operating norms.Healing the DEI OfficersThursday, 7/20/23, 1-4 pmFacilitating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should/must confront the history and apparatus of racism. DEI practitioners’ bodies become the container for the resistance of shifting power dynamics.  The DEI arena consists of practitioners who were promoted to often ambiguous positions without the benefit of committed leadership and the authority to move the needle of racial equity in policy and practice. This session will explore the restraining forces that take a toll on the economic, emotional, mental well-being of practitioners, and ultimately resulting in physical health challenges and a diminished quality of work life.  Participants will share strategies to cope in toxic environments and will learn ways to leverage healing technologies in the moment to develop a practice of self-care in the workplace.Interior Design Principles for Trauma-Exposed PublicsThursday, 8/17/23, 1-4 pmThe work environment can promote productivity and a healing space for those who work in trauma-exposed environments. Often, social health practitioners are exposed to vicarious trauma as a result of working with community members who are experiencing chronic and compound stress. The interior composition of a client serving environment can further induce toxic stress. This session will explore how the positioning of furniture in the workplace, color pallets, art, lighting, plants, sound and ergonomics can reduce stress for both provider and client. Participants will learn trauma informed design principles that promote wellness and biophilia in the workplace.Collaboration over CompetitionThursday, 9/21/23, 1-4 pmCapitalism is baked into institutions’ operating norms.  Disrupting Eurocentric ethos of rugged individualism, scarcity and competitiveness in the Black social uplift space is important to our collective movement and sustainability. Dismantling social determinants of health will require the disruption of silos that further reinforce competition over collective impact and outcomes.   To embrace the principles of Ubuntu (I am because we are) is to begin to unlearn the principles of bootstrapping.  Participants will learn how to incorporate the principles of Ubuntu, create and deepen partnerships and collaborations, and identify tools to interact with those who have not embraced the principles of Ubuntu.Dismantling the Myth of White Supremacy at WorkThursday, 10/19/23, 1-4 pmThe Myth of White Supremacy is centered in every aspect of workplace culture, interpersonally and structurally. It is not just the water in which we all exist; it is an anti-oppressive decision point that one ultimately decides to make or not to make. Dismantling the myth of white supremacy in work environments requires individuals, communities, and organizations to understand the stakes and range of possibilities of either choice. This session will explore the tactics used to promote the myth of white supremacy culture, including supervisory styles, communication practices, competitive environments, and performance reviews.  Participants will engage in experiential processes that uncover the operating norms, as well as, uncover strategies to dismantle operational practices, policies, and procedures that reinforce and burden internal and external stakeholders. Facilitating Data-Driven REDIThursday, 11/16/23, 1-3 pm With a standard in place that defines and identifies what it means to be diverse, equitable and inclusive it becomes possible to measure diversity, equity and inclusion in a company, understand that company’s “level” of diversity, equity and inclusion against the standard and drive measurable and methodical results - i.e. make the company more diverse, equitable and inclusive over time. This requires data skills on the part of the facilitator and leaders in the company. This session will introduce participants to a new measurement system and tool for diversity, equity and inclusion, and methods for understanding decision funnels in companies that can be analyzed and utilized to drive improvements.These sessions are in part sponsored by Innovation Works."

Student Affairs and Science Building at Montgomery College Germantown Campus is a project that responds to the needs of the college to allow continued operation of a significant portion of the building even through construction. High performance glazing, integrated sun shading, an energy-efficient mechanical system, and infrastructure for solar photovoltaics contribute to the whole building’s LEED Gold Certification.The addition is organized with long linear elements, evoking concepts of shifting tectonic plates, to afford a maximized amount of internal space with access to natural light as well as spaces in between for commons and informal gathering. This concept also creates a vertical separation between the existing and new, and focuses the 100,000-sf renovation and addition on the new quad side. Working within the constraints of the existing structural system, the efficiently organized building houses an interdisciplinary program including teaching laboratories, classrooms, offices, and informal learning spaces.

BE BETTER","https://www.eventbrite.com/e/be-bold-be-brilliant-be-badass-be-better-tickets-640720852317?aff=ebdssbdestsearch","Kim Webster","https://www.eventbrite.com/o/kim-webster-26252883737","TEDxUStreetWomen is a local, independently organized event to be held in Washington DC. We want this to be an event that strives to recreate the unique experience found at TED, where the world’s leading thinkers and doers congregate to share what they are most passionate about. At its core, the fundamental goal of TED and TEDxUStreetWomen is to foster and spread great ideas while celebrating Washington DC and the U Street Corridor community. 														  			Bold + Brilliant = Badass is our Mantra! What do we mean when we say, Bold + Brilliant =  Badass?  To be Bold, means you are willing to speak out for the issues that mean the most to you.  To be Brilliant, means you have the experience, knowledge, and passion needed to advocate for your idea. When you combine Bold + Brilliant, the results is a Badass. Being a Badass means that, despite your fear, any potential backlash/criticism, or how unpopular your idea maybe to some, you will still push forward to share your truth.   														  BE BOLD.   BE BRILLIANT.   BE BADASS.
  BE BETTER 
 We've all heard the saying - do better.  We've even challenged ourselves to do better.  This year's theme takes doing better to another level.  You will hear speakers share their ideas on how doing is not enough, we as humans need to BE Better.  To be better means to do things at a higher degree often and consistently to create sustainability. Join us as we look at ways to Be Better humans. Are you ready to be a part of a network and connect with individuals who are Bold, Brilliant and Badass?Why TEDxUStreetWomenWomen are realizing that the way things used to be is not the way things should be. More and more, women are becoming empowered to break the glass ceilings and strive towards finding their place in leadership roles. Roles that challenges the old way of thinking while creating opportunities for women to make a difference in the world. Women are not new to leadership; think of Cleopatra or Queen Elizabeth. Think of the women who led the civil rights and education reform movements. However, women are still outnumbered by men in the most prestigious positions, from Capitol Hill to the board room.Although a lot is being done to change the way women are seen, much still needs to be done. Women make up more than half the U.S. population, yet there are only one in five women in Congress. Men still out pace women in salaries and positions. Women across the globe are regaining their confidence and becoming bold, brilliant and unapologetic. During this conference, we will celebrate, not only the successes of women, but ponder on ways to be innovative and inspirational. Ways to affect the planet and the people on it.We want to change the social norms and empower women to be Bold and Brilliant.  We don't want women to be ashamed of speaking their truths.  This platform is for Badass women who want to share their idea that can change the world!Why U Street Corridor?As a 6th generation Washingtonian, I’ve always known U Street to be a community build on activism. Arthur Ashe once said, “The corner of 14th and U was the grapevine. . . . If you were at that corner, you always had the sense that something big was about to happen”.  Known as Washington’s cultural center at the turn of the century, U Street has long been a backbone of the city’s homegrown jazz, arts, and civil rights movements. Once bearing the scars of riots and protests, today it has regained its rightful place as the street to showcase DC’s vibrant cultural life, from music and food to activism and art. U Street has historically brought Washingtonians together to the sound of its homegrown music, from jazz and blues to rock and go-go. Today its renovated clubs, new restaurants and shops are once again the center of DC’s humming nightlife. U Street is home for those who want to march to their own beat.  It’s both historic and colorful, boasting some of the richest culture of the city and full of bars, restaurants, and boutiques – as well as plenty of DC locals who come to enjoy the culture and the people-watching.

Understanding the importance of this goal and addressing the climate challenges before us, PEC staff will share how our work encourages policies, zoning, and individual actions that help reduce power demand and emissions, capture and sequester carbon in our forests and soils, and promote distributed renewable energy options. To add to the challenge, the proliferation of high energy use data centers is shifting the goalpost and making the VCEA goals all that much more difficult to meet. While the growth of data centers within the major data center hub of northern Virginia continues at a fast pace, communities throughout Virginia are now starting to see more proposals for data centers.Agenda9:30 a.m. | Check-in/Meet & Greet10:00 a.m. | Welcome & PEC Update from John McCarthy, Senior Advisor & Director of Strategic Partnerships10:30 a.m. | Keynote Address by Dr. Maime Parker: “The Passion, Inspiration, and Excellence (PIE) in Collaboration""12:00 p.m. | Community Lunch with Local Ingredients (sponsored by Country Chevy)1:00 p.m. | Workshops 2﻿:30 p.m. | DepartThank you to our generous sponsors!C﻿ountry ChevroletP﻿low & Hearth"

Aaron's passion and love of hockey came to what he thought would be an abrupt halt in 2005, but his determination continued, ultimately leading him to a 5-year career playing professional hockey. His journeys and successes wouldn't have been possible without the extremely powerful visualization practice he developed. Aaron has a truly inspiring story of overcoming a tremendous amount of adversity. His hockey career, post-secondary studies, and personal experiences led Aaron to develop his unique practice.

We will read a mix of non-fiction, novels, essays, speculative fiction, sci-fi and graphic novels that provide a diverse lens on the people, places, and spaces that are affected by our changing climate. This book club is hosted by Jess Schreibstein. Jess just finished a graduate degree in Sustainability from Harvard at the end of 2022 and served as Communications Lead of our local Sunrise Movement chapter during the 2020 election cycle. She has been hosting this book club virtually since 2020 and is excited to bring an in-person version to her favorite local bookstore!The first book is Healing Grounds by Liz Carlisle. About HEALING GROUNDS:A powerful movement is happening in farming today—farmers are reconnecting with their roots to fight climate change. For one woman, that’s meant learning her tribe’s history to help bring back the buffalo. For another, it’s meant preserving forest purchased by her great-great-uncle, among the first wave of African Americans to buy land. Others are rejecting monoculture to grow corn, beans, and squash the way farmers in Mexico have done for centuries. Still others are rotating crops for the native cuisines of those who fled the “American wars” in Southeast Asia.In Healing Grounds, Liz Carlisle tells the stories of Indigenous, Black, Latinx, and Asian American farmers who are reviving their ancestors’ methods of growing food—techniques long suppressed by the industrial food system. These farmers are restoring native prairies, nurturing beneficial fungi, and enriching soil health. While feeding their communities and revitalizing cultural ties to land, they are steadily stitching ecosystems back together and repairing the natural carbon cycle. This, Carlisle shows, is the true regenerative agriculture – not merely a set of technical tricks for storing CO2 in the ground, but a holistic approach that values diversity in both plants and people.Cultivating this kind of regenerative farming will require reckoning with our nation’s agricultural history—a history marked by discrimination and displacement. And it will ultimately require dismantling power structures that have blocked many farmers of color from owning land or building wealth. The task is great, but so is its promise. By coming together to restore these farmlands, we can not only heal our planet, we can heal our communities and ourselves.Healing Grounds is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!"

I began my journey with natural dyes in 2014. Through a desire for a new wardrobe free of visible stains, I dyed my own clothing at first. I expanded to anything I could get my hands on, exploring different types of fabrics and plants. Beginning the following year, I enriched myself in the textile community of the San Francisco Bay Area, learning from and being inspired by some truly amazing artists. I continued my art education by attending craft and folk schools around the country, focusing on indigo and natural dyes.My current art practice focuses on using local and seasonal dye plants. With my practice has come a deeper understanding of sustainability. Each day I tune into plants a little bit more, especially aware of how the dye process is a continuation of the life cycle of the plant itself.

The tour will delve into Shipman's collaboration with architect Charles Adams Platt on plans for the estate, the aesthetic principles underlying her original ""wild garden"" designs, and the Conservancy's ongoing work to interpret her plans, and to restore and rehabilitate the Tregaron landscape within this historic framework.Anne Dawson's interest in the history and design of Tregaron stems from a background in Historic Garden Rehabilitation, graduate work in Art History and practical work in both landscape and interior design. Living in Cleveland Park since 2004, she has experienced the enormous changes brought about by the Conservancy in recapturing Ellen Biddle Shipman's vision and launching sustainability initiatives at Tregaron. As a member of the DC community, she is interested in sharing the story of this dynamic landscape so that, as visitors walk the paths, they can engage more deeply with Tregaron’s designed environment and the nature that enfolds them in this very special place.The group will gather at 3100 Macomb Street NW. Tregaron has mulch trails and moderate elevation changes. Wear comfortable shoes and bring a water bottle. Questions?

I began my journey with natural dyes in 2014. Through a desire for a new wardrobe free of visible stains, I dyed my own clothing at first. I expanded to anything I could get my hands on, exploring different types of fabrics and plants. Beginning the following year, I enriched myself in the textile community of the San Francisco Bay Area, learning from and being inspired by some truly amazing artists. I continued my art education by attending craft and folk schools around the country, focusing on indigo and natural dyes.My current art practice focuses on using local and seasonal dye plants. With my practice has come a deeper understanding of sustainability. Each day I tune into plants a little bit more, especially aware of how the dye process is a continuation of the life cycle of the plant itself. When I'm not dyeing, I’m teaching at a preschool, playing with flowers, crafting at home and taking care of my many house plants. I can't wait to share more with you!"
