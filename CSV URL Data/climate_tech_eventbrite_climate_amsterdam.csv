Delve into climate and energy futures and gauge the influence of disruptive climate change events on potential evolutions in citizen energy choices. About the WorkshopHorizon Europe ECOSENS-project.eu has created a workshop transporting participants to the year 2050. Join the 2050 Citizens' Committee for Energy Advice and work with others to develop recommendations for the European Commission on achieving a more balanced energy mix. After reading a 2050 newspaper reporting the extreme weather and “how we got here”, specialist and non-specialist stakeholders will delve into narrative and ethical arguments, explore trade-offs, and critically examine societal pathways and obstacles to a resilient energy mix.  The 3-hour in-person workshop will be very interactive, engaging group discussions, cooperative deliberation, and collaborative tasks.B﻿ackgroundAccording to the IPCC, before 2035 the average temperature on Earth is projected to surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists have warned that the probability of climate extremes increases with every tenth of a degree of warming. Innovation and disruptive climate events will have increasingly significant impact on both daily life and energy sources, with new evolutions in economic, social, and environmental factors driving energy demand. By projecting ourselves now into 2050, can we perceive more clearly what societal responses should be?  Scenario tools provide a context for exploring a range of possible future outcomes. They create space to exchange ideas and insights on how policies are shaped or changed in the face of new information.

Through a combination of theory and hands-on exercises, we’ll examine the various paths that can be taken to a cleaner, smarter and more caring fashion future. Together with a stellar line up of speakers and workshop hosts, we will collectively investigate the overarching goal of sustainable and circular fashion design. The program includes topics and methodologies such as local regeneration, material understanding  and craft, and remake & upcycle skills. Join us at NOoF's sustainable fashion and textile LAB for two fun and exploratory days with a group of like-minded individuals who wish to commit to a better fashion future!PROGRAM OUTLINEDay one:  What is sustainable fashion? What is the difference between circular and regenerative? How can the Fibreshed approach make a blueprint for the future of fashion & getting in touch with natural materials: working with your hands for craft methodolgies. Day two:  Upcycling through bio-based screen printing, 'remake' a bucket hat, and a Trashtalk from community visionaries Trashclub. E﻿XPERTS & MENTORSEvey Kwong [futurprimitiv]Evey Kwong is a designer and researcher whose practice evolves in the theme of craft-based technology by connecting with the origin of material cultures, people and place.Her works have been exhibited at the Museum of European Cultures [DE], HOW&WOW BASK IT! [Dutch Design Week] and U-JOINTS: Knots & Knits [Fiskars Biennale, FI]. fueled by her desire to promote crafts making, she collaborates with various institutions on design research projects and workshops. For the Design for Change Retreat, Evey will lead the workshop ‘Connecting Twines’. The earliest twine was made by twisting, untwisting and braiding lengths of plant fiber. Twine is most commonly used in textiles and basketry. The invention of twine is at least as important as the development of stone tools for early humans. Archaeologists have called the development of twine, which can be made stronger and longer than its component fibers, “the string revolution”.Pollyanna MossPollyanna Moss engages in local practices of crafts and explores their inherent narratives. Her work materialises subjective and complex relationships between humans and the environment through design pieces and video installations, which together provide a careful reading of the landscapes she investigates. Through her design practice, Pollyanna develops strong working relationships with multiple parties - co-ordinating and communicating through shared care for the environment, and the species that inhabit various local domains. For the Design for Change Retreat, Pollyanna will be presenting her project 'Shed and Heddle', which explores a 15km production radius for local regenerative wool blankets, in a scalable format. Helen MilneHelen Milne is the LAB Manager at New Order of Fashion (NOoF) and deep dives into circular & regenerative design research and education. She writes and mentors NOoF residencies and leads the circular theory classes taught at the LAB for schools, university students and companies. She has a BA in Textile Design (Woven Specialism) from Central St. Martins  and an MA in Contextual Design from Design Academy Eindhoven. She's particularly interested in embodied craft knowledges, connecting diverse practitioners and developing practical examples of circular design methods. For the Design for Change Retreat, Helen will introdcue you to the overall landscape of Circular Design methodologies in Fashion, and be present throughout the week for discussions, organisation, and your main point of reference from NOoF! UNCOLOUR StudiosUNCOLOUR Studios is a textile innovations start-up that is developing the first entirely biodegradable and bio-based silk screen printing ink with natural colours from the food industry and agricultural waste, founded by Anabel Poh and Sarah Roseman. Anabel Poh is a Singaporean independent textile designer and innovation consultant and Sarah Roseman is a Canadian independent object and textile designer. UNCOLOUR Studios intends to push the frontiers of industrial printing in textiles by precisely developing a one-of-a-kind natural silkscreen binder. Hence, giving a viable commercially-scaleable alternative within the textile industry to replace plastisol- or acrylic-based screen printing inks.For the Design for Change Retreat, UNCOLOUR Studios invite you to learn how to upcycle your textiles, bags, clothes, and accessories using eco-friendly techniques. They will guide you through the entire process of silkscreen printing and help you to discover the beauty of natural colours. You will create your own vibrant, natural colour palette, and have the opportunity to experiment with printing different patterns, motifs, and designs, by creating your own temporary stencil patterns. Wolter PotRotterdam based designer Wolter Pot is the hottest face on the Dutch fashion scene, navigating the moment with his unconventional (yet sustainable) approach to fashion. Pot describes him selves as typical dutch, 'Simple shapes with a huge gesture'.For the Design for Change Retreat, Wolter  will guide participants through the process of turning old towels into treasures. We take towels as a base to create a bucket hat: a perfect and easy summer accessory!Fibreshed NederlandFibershed is a global movement of local communities developing regional fiber systems that build soil and protect the health of our biosphere.

The focus will be on “Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment”. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day. Programme9.00 – Registration & Coffee9.30 –  Keynote:  Ton van Vlimmeren (Netherlands) – Libraries Building Sustainable CommunitiesTon van Vlimmeren is the President of the European Library Organization (EBLIDA), member of the Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Libraries Section of IFLA and one of the founders of Public Libraries 2030. This keynote will highlight how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help libraries on their journey towards a sustainable, inclusive, and democratic society10.20 – Lightning Talks: STRATEGIES & CHALLENGES: IMPLEMENTING SDGS IN LIBRARIESMinna Männikkö (Finland) – Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap: Climate Action in Oulu, Finland In 2020, Oulu City Library implemented a Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap. Based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library’s daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) – Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) – Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 –  Coffee Break 11.30 – Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) – Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups – shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) – SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) – MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 – Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 –  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) – Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant. In this keynote, we will tell the story of how the SDGs became a guiding principle for the library. They are now one of the four impact chains. The library of Midden-Brabant has developed a method to work with communities on societal issues, such as the SDGs. We will share how the LocHal library worked offline and online with the community around urban nature, reaching more than 25,000 people.14.10 – Lighting Talks and Workshop: INSPIRE & EMPOWER: EXAMPLES ACROSS THE GLOBEPriscilla Pun (China) – 10 Ways to Make Your Library Green This presentation will provide examples of libraries as actors and educators for sustainable development, in line with ENSULIB’s definition of a Green Library. Examples include creating and promoting shared resources or facilities (sharing economy), reducing consumption, using environmentally friendly library buildings and equipment, and demonstrating commitment to international environmental goals and programmes.Tim Schumann (Germany) – The Berlin-Pankow Public Library Going Green The Berlin-Pankow Public Library is on its way to become a Green Library by embracing its role as an actor in an ecologically and socially sustainable future. This presentation will describe current measures of the library in terms of diversity, management, and partnerships, becoming a third place in the community, and how this relates to its goal of becoming a Green Library.Workshop: Helena Öberg Carlsson (Sweden) – Transition Stories Beyond Dystopia and Carbon RuinsThrough storytelling and sharing experiences, we can foster a sense of belonging and collective agency for change. This workshop is based on a scientific master narrative that has been used as a spinning wheel for a dynamic process involving public libraries in Västmanland County, Lund University, artists and local stakeholders, where it has initiated a process to reveal the potential of public libraries as arenas for transition and change.15.30 – Coffee Break15.50 – Panel Discussion and Closing:  CLIMATE ACTION: COUNT LIBRARIES IN!A panel of library leaders from around the world will come together to share and discuss the role of libraries as actors of climate empowerment.16.30 – Self-guided Tour of LocHal and Social GatheringM﻿ore information can be found on our website:https://www.ifla.org/events/ifla-wlic-satellite-meeting-2023-libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment/"

The people of this region, also called the S.W.A.N.A region, have been struggling to find an autonomous environment to live in due to entangled geo-politics, oil trade, religious dogma and war that have been effecting the area since before WWI. Each of our guests deals with this history of the region to position their practice in the current political climate. However, artists, researchers and historians that raise their voice are often oppressed and therefore have to continue resisting with different methodologies and approaches. Diana Al-Halabi’s research unfolds through various mediums and brings in different histories of the region. Veronika Babayan transfers feminine generational knowledge through her artistic practice that deals  with antagonistic histories. Whereas JINA Collective is a feminist leftist activist group and community that emerged from the Woman, Life, Freedom Revolution in Iran.Diana Al-Halabi’s current research  ""Famine and Hunger strike: Decolonizing the Digestive""  constitutes two sides of the same coin. Famine and hunger strikes render the digestive system another political site of struggle. While famines are a top-down force often engineered by governments to subordinate their people, hunger strikes are a bottom-up form of individual resistance often undertaken by political prisoners as a last resort for claiming their rights.Veronika Babayan’s work looks into generational trauma of the Armenian people due to the Armenian genocide. She uses fruit leather as a method of sharing a feminine practice of preservation and investigates the concept of collective trauma and motherhood. JINA collective started to form in 2022 in solidarity with, and alongside marginalised communities, and agents of the current unfolding revolution in Iran. They persevere to eradicate any form of tyranny, repression, and domination situated inside the borders of Iran, as well as in the broader region, and beyond. The menu will depart from the recipe letters of Mücella Yapıcı and Çiğden Mater, political prisoners in Turkey. These two women take on women’s prison survival skills for cooking and reheating their meals. The knowledge that circulates around different prisons in Turkey forms an alliance among prisoners as well as forming resistance by holding on to an essential human pleasure: taste. Yapıcı cooks elaborate traditional Turkish recipes with an electric water kettle and the limited means available in prison, whereas Mater shares these ingenious recipes through letters to her friends."

https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-floatation-tank-book-your-session-630875143537?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,West Den Haag,https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/west-den-haag-8971175698,"‘In the province of the mind, in the inside reality, what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be discovered experientially and experimentally. When so determined these limits are found to be further beliefs to be transcended.’*As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, we are proud to offer visitors the opportunity to personally experience John C. Lilly's tank isolation technique. The original concept was devised by John Lilly as a research instrument in 1954. In the ensuing decades, Lilly would go on to simplify and perfect the solitude, isolation and confinement tank, making it safer to build and use even for those untrained in this kind of research. The floatation tank that is available for visitors to use was inspired by Lilly's original tank designs. The floatation tank is a medium for process. It removes 99% of sensory input sources, assisting the user in cultivating an awareness of their internal state of being and attuning to their senses within and without the tank. Similar to meditation, many people enter into a relationship with sensory deprivation practices with certain expectations about what is going to happen. 'All we can say to these people is — nothing will happen that you don’t already know about; nothing can happen that you will not allow to happen, i.e.: “What is forbidden is not allowed.”' The possibilities for application of the tank isolation technique are multiple, ranging from simple relaxation in the weightlessness of the salt solution, pain relief for individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and psychonautic exploration of consciousness, with many certainly yet to be discovered. The relative lack of contemporary awareness of and research into sensory deprivation is partially due to the inaccessibility of the medium to the public. Floatation centres are scarce and expensive. Especially centres that endeavour to create an environment conducive to exploration, experimentation and reflection are lacking. West hopes to become such an environment throughout the exhibition of the floatation tank, providing an (albeit temporary) embryonic escape through sensory deprivation from life in a cultural climate characterised by flagrant overstimulation. An impossible space for self-interrogation of The Deep Self. * John C. Lilly (1915-2001), The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, (Distributor).What to consider before booking a timeslot You will be in an enclosed space in the absence of light and sound for +/- 1 hour, so if you are claustrophobic or fear the dark this is something to consider. However, as there is no light influx whatsoever in the tank, the inside appears more spacious to the user than it is in reality. This often negates feelings of claustrophobia. Even if you are claustrophobic, please feel free to come give it a try. Your session can be stopped at any time if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. You will be suspended in a solution of Water, Magnesium Sulfate, and Hydrogen peroxide (<100ppm), maintained around 33-34 degrees Celsius (skin temperature). The solution has a neutral pH (7.1), compatible with that of human skin. The solution is filtered and treated between each user. However, if any of the following apply to you, we recommend you do not participate in this installation:You have open wounds anywhere on your body. This includes conditions such as scalp eczema, skin ulcers, yeast infections, or athlete’s foot. This is for your own well-being (seeing as the highly dense salt solution will sting quite a bit on open or irritated skin) and for the well-being of subsequent users of the floatation tank. The same naturally applies to any other infectious diseases.You are currently menstruating, are easily susceptible to urinary tract infections, or are in the process of healing from gender-affirming surgery. If you are pregnant, please consult your physician before booking a session.You suffer from diarrhea or gastroenteritis/are living with bladder or bowel incontinence.You have low blood pressure.You are epileptic.You are diagnosed with an acute psychological/psychiatric condition. Please consult your respective mental health professional here, do your research and use your best judgement.Any questions about particular conditions’ compatibility (such as specific physical disabilities) with floatation therapy can be directed towards the contact listed at the end of this information sheet. We strongly discourage any visitors from entering the tank under the influence of any and all mind-altering substances (excluding prescription medications taken at the behest of a medical professional). If the host is under the impression that you are in any way inebriated you will not be allowed inside the tank and your participation fee will not be refunded. The risks of this far outweigh whatever rewards you might have read about. The tank is wheelchair accessible, though please do inform us prior to your session if you require any particular assistance.Please be advised that you will be required to sign a liability waiver before entering the tank.  For more information, please contact us at kevin@westdenhaag.nl!P﻿lease arrive 15 minutes before your session!What to bringTowelFreshly washed bathing suit (optional)Slippers Bathrobe (optional)Shampoo and hairbrush (if you have long hair)Sunglasses for your way home (advisable)M﻿oisturiser - at least for the face/neck and hands, if not a lotion for the  entire body. This can also be applied later at home after your float. Especially important if you are prone to contact dermatitis. Magnesium sulfate is however generally well tolerated.It is necessary to shower before and after your session. Antibacterial soap is provided, but feel free to bring your own.It is best to limit your caffeine and nicotine intake the day of your float.Shaving the day of your float is also not advisable, as the salt solution may sting and cause irritation on freshly shaven skin."

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals. The School of Life’s drive to spread greater self-awareness and The Humblebrag’s action-oriented courses make for a perfect combination to support the next generations of agenda-setting change-makers. We hope that participants will not only become aware of their own purpose and values but will also be able to put them into action through storytelling and taking a stand on important social and climate issues.Practical informationDuration and location: 2 days on location in the center of Amsterdam, including coffee, tea and a delicious organic, vegetarian lunch.  Number of participants: max 25 persons  Price: € 825 excluding VATLanguage: English Accessibility: at location Frederiksplein, easy to reach by public transport.  Study load: there is no compulsory homework.
