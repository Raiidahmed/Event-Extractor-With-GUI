To achieve the Dutch policy objective to reduce carbon emissions by 55% in 2030, a shift from fossil towards renewable energy resources is required. Within the Netherlands, geothermal energy is a proven renewable energy resource, but currently only with a limited number of operating installations. Presently producing geothermal projects in the Netherlands are generally located in areas where abundant subsurface data is available.A limiting factor to the broader development of geothermal projects is the fact that the subsurface data in the Netherlands is not well distributed; seismic & well data coverage is poor in roughly half of the country, including major residential and industrial areas with high heat demand. Improving the data coverage in these areas would increase the benefit-risk ratio of geothermal projects. 
In 2017 a framework study was carried out by Energie Beheer Nederland B.V. (EBN) and the TNO Advisory Group for Economic Affairs (TNO-AGE) to identify what data acquisition is required to overcome this data limitation.Subsequently, EBN and TNO-AGE have embarked on a geothermal exploration program (SCAN: ‘Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland’) to acquire additional subsurface data to decrease subsurface uncertainty and hence shape the conditions needed to encourage the development of geothermal projects. This program is government funded through the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate.
The SCAN program is focused on three key activities, namely:
1. The acquisition of regional 2D seismic data
2. The reprocessing of existing 2D seismic data
3. A data well campaign
The acquisition of the new seismic data started with a 2D test line in early 2019, which was carefully analysed to determine the optimum and affordable 2D acquisition parameter for the regional acquisition. The resulting key acquisition parameters were a shot spacing of 60m and a geophone spacing of 5m, using explosives as seismic source. In September 2019 the regional acquisition campaign started and lasted for almost 2.5 years, acquiring a total of 1800 km of 2D seismic and a total of almost 7500 km vintage seismic data is processed. All resulting data is made public free of charge on the SCAN website and the Dutch subsurface portal (NLOG). Based on this newly acquired data, ten search areas have been selected and the first SCAN well is planned to be drilled in 2023.A﻿bout JoahnnesMy name is Johannes van den Akker, I’m 30 years old and live in Amsterdam. I finished the Idea League Geophysics Master in 2018 and after graduating I was not really looking for an office job. I guess I got lucky and I started working for EBN B.V. in 2019 as an acquisition geophysicist. Since then I have been involved in the Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland (SCAN) project, mainly in the field for the acquisition of 2D seismic data. Recently I’ve been working on well development and data acquisition planning for the coming SCAN wells."

Designers and other actors in the production of space play an important role in this and are responsible for developing alternative building practices that help counter these negative trends.On Saturday June 24 we organise a gathering to discuss new roles that architects and urban designers can take up. How can we give shape to a different planning, design culture and construction industry? How can we learn to have positive footprints before a carbon lockdown goes into effect? What does it mean to approach the (built) environment from a perspective of regeneration? What type of architects do we want to be? And how can we do so in a healthy work culture? We want to explore a way of working that goes beyond the competitive model of individual success and soloist genius, towards one of collaboration around socio-ecological ambitions.This work conference marks the end of the 5-year term of Renske van der Stoep and Thijs van Spaandonk as heads of the Masters in Architecture and Urbanism and a celebration of the education programme they introduced, “Design for the Rotterdam Climate Reality”.

Ontwerpers en andere actoren in de productie van de gebouwde omgeving spelen hierin een belangrijke rol en zijn mede verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen van een alternatieve bouwpraktijk die de negatieve tendensen weet om te buigen.Op zaterdag 24 juni gaan we in gesprek over nieuwe rollen die architecten en stedenbouwkundigen kunnen en moeten oppakken. Hoe kunnen we werken aan een andere planologie, ontwerpcultuur en bouwpraktijk? Hoe kunnen we bijvoorbeeld gebouwen een positieve footprint geven en voorkomen dat we in een totale CO2-lockdown terechtkomen? Hoe kunnen we de gebouwde omgeving ontwikkelen op basis van regeneratieve uitgangspunten? Wat voor ontwerpers willen we zijn? En hoe kunnen we een gezonde werkcultuur ontwikkelen?

https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-floatation-tank-book-your-session-630878122447?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/west-den-haag-8971175698,"‘In the province of the mind, in the inside reality, what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be discovered experientially and experimentally. When so determined these limits are found to be further beliefs to be transcended.’*As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, we are proud to offer visitors the opportunity to personally experience John C. Lilly's tank isolation technique. The original concept was devised by John Lilly as a research instrument in 1954. In the ensuing decades, Lilly would go on to simplify and perfect the solitude, isolation and confinement tank, making it safer to build and use even for those untrained in this kind of research. The floatation tank that is available for visitors to use was inspired by Lilly's original tank designs. The floatation tank is a medium for process. It removes 99% of sensory input sources, assisting the user in cultivating an awareness of their internal state of being and attuning to their senses within and without the tank. Similar to meditation, many people enter into a relationship with sensory deprivation practices with certain expectations about what is going to happen. 'All we can say to these people is — nothing will happen that you don’t already know about; nothing can happen that you will not allow to happen, i.e.: “What is forbidden is not allowed.”' The possibilities for application of the tank isolation technique are multiple, ranging from simple relaxation in the weightlessness of the salt solution, pain relief for individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and psychonautic exploration of consciousness, with many certainly yet to be discovered. The relative lack of contemporary awareness of and research into sensory deprivation is partially due to the inaccessibility of the medium to the public. Floatation centres are scarce and expensive. Especially centres that endeavour to create an environment conducive to exploration, experimentation and reflection are lacking. West hopes to become such an environment throughout the exhibition of the floatation tank, providing an (albeit temporary) embryonic escape through sensory deprivation from life in a cultural climate characterised by flagrant overstimulation. An impossible space for self-interrogation of The Deep Self. * John C. Lilly (1915-2001), The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, (Distributor).What to consider before booking a timeslot You will be in an enclosed space in the absence of light and sound for +/- 1 hour, so if you are claustrophobic or fear the dark this is something to consider. However, as there is no light influx whatsoever in the tank, the inside appears more spacious to the user than it is in reality. This often negates feelings of claustrophobia. Even if you are claustrophobic, please feel free to come give it a try. Your session can be stopped at any time if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. You will be suspended in a solution of Water, Magnesium Sulfate, and Hydrogen peroxide (<100ppm), and Sodium Citrate, maintained around 33-34 degrees Celsius (skin temperature). The solution has a neutral pH, compatible with that of human skin. The solution is filtered and treated between each user.However, if any of the following apply to you, we recommend you do not participate in this installation:You have open wounds anywhere on your body.

The day will be opened by the Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy Policy, Rob Jetten, and other speakers include high-level officials of the OECD and the European Commission. There will also be talks and workshops from senior representatives from government and academia. This event marks the conclusion of the EC DG REFORM funded TSI project “Precaution in the Energy Transition and Improved Knowledge for Hydrogen Risk Regulation.” The conference will take place in The Hague on the 5th of July 2023 in the brand-new Amare building and aims at presenting and disseminating main findings and recommendations of the OECD Project. The theme deals with important questions for the success of the energy transition. To successfully carry out the energy transition, inevitable risks that come with it need to be appropriately regulated. How should governments deal with questions of uncertainty, risk and precaution in regulating new energy technologies? This is the main question that will be addressed.  The day will also include practical discussions. For example, how to use recent tools and guidelines and the perspective of local administrators. The morning will be devoted to presentations and a panel discussion which focus on uncertainty in the energy transition with an emphasis on hydrogen risk regulation throughout. The afternoon will be filled with workshops on the following topics: hydrogen risk, precaution and uncertainty, tools for local political governance, risk policy principles, and learning from incidents. Each workshop will be given twice to give participants the opportunity to attend multiple.If you are interested to attend this event, please register for a free ticket on this page.There will be five workshops in the afternoon to go deeper into the issues. Each will be given twice, so you have the opportunity to attend two of them. In the registration form, please inform us of all the workshops you would like to attend, we will allocate them accordingly.Here is a short introduction to the workshops to help you select the ones that interest you most. Learning from IncidentsTransitions, such as the energy transition, require good legislation. Make laws and rules for the long term. Make room for learning, evaluation and experimentation. Dare to question existing systems. In this way, there is more room during implementation to respond quickly to all the new and uncertain aspects that occur in transitions.At the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, the Dutch Council for Public Administration issued an advisory paper on learning in transitions. The advice addresses the question of how learning in transitions is possible, without immediately wanting to cover every risk with new laws and regulations.The Council advises on the basis of principles of good public administration: the rule of law, democracy and administrative capacity. In transitions, things happen unintentionally, so it is necessary to create space for learning, and that sets requirements on public administration. Such as room to make mistakes and learn by trial and error: in other words to stumble and fall, get up again and keep on going.Moderator: Peter Verheij (member Dutch Council for Public Administration)Dutch Risk Policy Principles for the Energy TransitionThe energy transition needs urgent action, but our present system of regulating risk in the Netherlands is not always adequately suited to its innovative character.The Dutch Cabinet will in 2023 present a set of policy principles to deal responsibly with safety and health risks and accelerate the energy transition equally. These principles combine a continuation of good old practices (such as risk and knowledge based approach) with constructive and sound earlier advises, which have not been implemented yet. Additional new elements intend to make the risk approach more compatible with the innovative technologies that come with the energy transition.The risk policy principles, as well as the ideas and discussions surrounding them, will be explained by their developers from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management: Jan van Tol, Jos Benner and Rob Smal.Tools for Local Political governanceAny administrator or public representative who must make decisions about new projects for the energy transition will be familiar with this dilemma: the energy transition is necessary due to, among other things, the significant risk of climate change. But inevitably, as with any human activity, new technology will also introduce new risks. How do we decide what new risks are acceptable and which approach to the precautionary principle is suitable? A group of Dutch mayors, aldermen and provincial authorities, the working group for a safe energy transition (Bestuurlijk Overleg voor een Veilige Energietransitie in Nederland, BOVEN) believes that integral decision making is the way forward. This means taking both the positive and the negative risks of new technology into the equation. As an aid by that effort a new tool for local decision makers has been developed, the “risk mixing console”. This enables the comparison of existing and new safety and health risks using as common denominator the WHO disability adjusted life year (DALY).In this workshop the challenge for local authorities and the use of the risk mixing console will be discussed. Moderator: Ira Helsloot (professor Governance of Safety and Security, Radboud University)Hydrogen Risk RegulationThis work centres around dealing with risk uncertainty when adopting a new technology, hydrogen as a common based fuel and energy source, where there is an absence of agreed and shared understanding of the hazards and risks – even when the benefits of this technology are accepted. In response to global energy pressures and the urgent need to tackle climate many governments have set out ambitious energy transition policies and plans but delivering these changes into local communities has become a challenge in the light of uncertainty about the risks. The workshop will explore the dynamics of risk based regulation and societal acceptance of these new technologies.Moderator: Ian TraversUncertainty and Precaution in the Energy TransitionInformation to follow, check back soon."

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals. The School of Life’s drive to spread greater self-awareness and The Humblebrag’s action-oriented courses make for a perfect combination to support the next generations of agenda-setting change-makers.

The film shows the struggle of Kiribati’s president, Ton, against the backdrop of UN climate negotiations in Paris. This is dramatically strung through a telling of the personal story of Tiemeri, a mother of six who is trying everything she can to ensure that she and her family can move to safety in New Zealand.The film screening will be followed by a special Hague Talks and discussion where we will delve into the topic of ecocide, environmental justice, and how Mozambique and its Chief Justice is working to secure a more just future for its people.About the speakers: Jojo Mehta, a Co-Founder and Executive Director of Stop Ecocide International. Jojo has been at the forefront of the movement to establish ecocide as a crime at the International Criminal Court. Her extensive experience in coordinating legal developments, diplomatic traction, and public narrative, coupled with her clear and engaging communication style, make her an inspiring and knowledgeable speaker to address the pressing issue of environmental justice.Mert Kumru is an avid campaigner for World Youth for Climate Justice here in Europe. Now that climate justice is becoming a much more broadly accepted term, Mert offers us the opportunity to learn more about seeking justice for those affected by climate change.Ida Simonsen will moderate the event. Ida  is a farmer in training, agroecology activist, and Dutch UN Youth Representative on Biodiversity and Food. She is primarily active at the intersection of environmental justice, human rights and agrarian transformation with a focus on democratisation and youth participation. The event aligns with the overall theme of The Hague Justice Week 2023 , which is to promote and discuss justice and human rights on different scales. By focusing on environmental justice, the event highlights the critical role that the law plays in protecting the environment and ensuring that justice is served for both people and the planet."

It will take place 6-7 July 2023 in Amsterdam.  DescriptionThe VSR, the Dutch and Flemish Law and Society association, has existed since 1980 and is an association for researchers and practicing lawyers who themselves conduct research in the field of the empirical workings of law or are interested in it. During our annual two-day conference researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (sociologists of law, legal anthropologists, legal psychologists, public administration experts and criminologists) present their findings. See the VSR website for more details about its structure and goals.The theme for this year's Annual Conference is: The Next Generation.Society as a whole is faced with challenges on how to move further and how to ensure the next generation can thrive. Topics such as the climate crisis, migration, democratic backsliding, the role of technology are just a few of the pressing issues we are faced with. The Next Generation also means pushing boundaries, employing different approaches and creating space for junior academics and those voices in academia who do not always get the same space. All themes will be running throughout the whole conference. Our keynote speaker pushes boundaries with her approach to research, we want to connect scholars who have something to offer and those who seek help via Academic Speed Dating and create space for voices in academia who do not always get the same platform as others.There will be a conference fee to pay for food and drinks (tea and coffee, lunch and one reception with snacks included) during the conference. As a participant you can sign up for the conference dinner as well.

His material varies from cheese to driving, from climate change to the end of the world!

Join us as we plunge into the depths of this elusive challenge: to use technology to speak to nature.In collaboration with the Climate Action program of TU Delft, Studium Generale presents a series on climate change, and at its heart lies an extraordinary creature: the jellyfish. Developed by PhD candidate Letizia Artioli, our jellyfish is a multimedia installation that breathes life into climate data, translating it into colour and sound. Help us welcome the jellyfish to the surface in The Library, in an encounter bridging nature and humanity.Herman Russchenberg, professor in Atmospheric Remote Sensing and TU Delft vice rector magnificus for climate action, will give a short presentation on the current state of climate science.SpeakersThe Jellyfish has been set the goal of engaging in conversation with humanity. It can translate atmospheric data, as well as the voices of future generations, or the outraged citizen. However, as a transparent, calmly floating marine creature, it may prove challenging to read.Herman Russchenberg is a full professor in Atmospheric Remote Sensing and the head of the Department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing. Since 2021, he has been the TU Delft vice rector magnificus for climate action. He leads the TU Delft Climate Institute.Letizia Artioli is an Architecture PhD candidate at the University of Venice, as well as part of the MA ArtScience at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Hague. She is the founder of the Venice Climate Change Pavilion, an innovative project at the intersection of art and science, augmented reality, and tactical urbanism. She developed the jellyfish.Leon Heuts is a philosopher and the head of Studium Generale."

Climate change is multi-faceted and complicated. Limitless dreaming is necessary to create solutions. But where does the impetus come from and how can we translate clean energy ideas into reality without negative externalities? Join our Teach-In, to discover the interaction between the government and innovators to reach our climate goals, on May 31st at 3pm on Strand de Esch and get creative as we build castles and futures out of sand."
