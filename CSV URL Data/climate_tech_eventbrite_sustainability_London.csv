Further, it suggests the prospect of implementing the notion of decolonial ecology, which involves decolonizing the mind, to revive indigenous histories and foster ethical ecological practises that can contribute to the advancement of planetary sustainability.Goutam Karmakar is an NRF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Faculty of Education at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa.

With current industry challenges being significant – record cost of food inflation, staff shortages, record closures in the independent sector, the food service sector is going through some testing times again. And at the same time the IPCC Report recently published has shown collectively we are way behind targets to reduce emissions to avoid global warming of 1.5C. There are significant external targets to meet around Sustainability such as the Government’s Net Zero targets, demand for broader ESG Reporting, and other related regulations to comply with.There are also many messages out there about how businesses need to reduce their emissions, and work towards Net Zero, including using ‘Less but better meat’, mixed messages about how relevant counting carbon emissions is, requirements for consideration of health and calories, and new terms such as ‘regenerative’ being used. With these events, our aim is to bring together key industry sustainable supply chain change agents including Soil Association Organic Certification, The Ethical Butcher, Pasture for Life Assurance, to provide clarity and to help drive solutions to some of the key challenges we face as we all aim to adopt more sustainable supply chains.Event 2 – Sustainable Sourcing Strategies in Hospitality: Finding SolutionsTuesday 23rd May 2023 | 6pm – 9pm The Duke of Cambridge Pub, 30 Saint Peter’s Street, London, England, N1 8JTA workshop seeking potential solutions within sustainable food sourcing in the hospitality sector and how we can and must go further.

Produced as part of Retrofit 23 and taking place on Wednesday evenings at the Building Centre, this series showcases research and ideas on the residential retrofit challenge. The panels feature guest speakers presenting a project or provocation, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. Join us for these thought-provoking sessions and meet and share with others involved in the retrofit puzzle. In this session on 19th July, panellists will explore community organisation and action and present case studies, before we open up a discussion with our audience.   Lily Green of Hubbub: “The Big Street Upgrade: how can community action break down barriers to retrofitting?”	 John Christophers of Retrofit Balsall Heath: “Community-led = Retrofit Reimagined?”  Hubbub is a charity which believes that to create positive environmental change at the scale and speed needed, we need to get everyone on board. That's why since 2014, they've been designing campaigns that inspire ways of living that are good for the environment. In partnership with OVO Energy Solutions and support from Glasgow City Council, Hubbub are running the Big Street Upgrade, a project supporting a community in Glasgow. Lily Green will talk about this process – to enable the community to make both individual and collective improvements to make their homes more energy efficient.  Retrofit Balsall Heath is a local community group, two years old - but building on local green initiatives going back more than 15 years.  This diverse inner-city area in Birmingham includes the UK’s first zero carbon retrofit, IFEES (the Islamic Foundation for Ecology & Environmental Sciences) founded in 1980s and Bahu Trust, accredited observers at UN climate and biodiversity summits.  John Christophers will talk about his work with this group, and ideas that neighbourhood scale retrofit can’t be top-down, it must be community led, collective street-by-street action.  Rafe Bertram Sustainability Facilitator at Enfield Council will chair this session. Rafe’s role at the London Borough of Enfield is Retrofit Asset Manager, Sustainability Lead of Meridian Water and Joint Interim Head of Climate Action and Sustainability across the council.

– A unified ESG Scoring and measurement framework for stakeholder capitalism that FinTech can comply with, measure and be regulated to delivery capacity.
Background
FinTech SMEs find it challenging to identify methods that best suit them to bridge the gap between unsustainable and sustainable practices. Various ESG frameworks target various industry sectors, but SMEs find it challenging to identify a framework method that best suits them, as they seek to comply with emerging United Kingdom regulations. Led by the WCIT Financial Services Technology Panel, a group of industry experts on ESG, Risk and Sustainability, and post-graduate MSc students of the City, University of London conducted a comparative study of various ESG frameworks, coming up with suggestions for a unified ESG scoring and measuring framework for stakeholder capitalism that can be measured and regulated to deliver capability for FinTech SMEs. The Speakers will present the findings from the study and the recommendations of practical frameworks that assist in the development of business capability in meeting ESG targets and how using the Social Value Capability Improvement Model developed by the WCIT can assist in terms of the recommended frameworks and in terms of its ability to deliver guidance on evaluating an organisation's progress against its own ESG agenda.

What are the innovations and scientific discoveries shaping our future?The Innovations for a Sustainable Future exhibition seeks to create a dialogue between science, society, culture and art. Its main aim is to address current global issues and the inevitable role science and new technologies will play in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set up by the United Nations in 2015 as a blueprint for a better, more sustainable future for all. The 17 SDGs were adopted by all UN member states agreeing to work on, among other things, a plan to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve gender equality and avert climate threats by 2030.This interactive augmented reality exhibition was artistically rendered by the renowned Czech graphic designer Pavel Fuksa, drawing from the concept of the successful Czech Innovation Expo which travelled the world presenting Czech scientific discoveries and innovations. The new London exhibition highlights innovations and issues on a European level, reflecting the higher purpose of science with special emphasis on the means needed to implement the ambitious SGDs.How the Exhibition WorksVisitors will see seemingly static outdoor panels with abstract symbols on the walls. After downloading the exhibition app (available free for Android and iOS), they will see the space around them come to life on their devices, allowing them to explore in a fun and unique way a variety of scientific stories and fascinating information about technological innovations contributing to our sustainable future.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [CSRD] has to be incorporated into member state law by 2024, and with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards [ESRS] being adopted in June this year, businesses are scrambling. They need to prepare existing systems and processes or overhaul them completely to produce consistent, comparable, and quality data that is compliant with the regulation. And they need to do this at speed. A lack of clarity as to how the upcoming regulation will impact businesses and what they will be legally obliged to disclose, combined with differing global collection standards and capabilities has meant many are already behind in their preparation for the CSRD. The pressure is building as the risk of not being CSRD compliant increases. On top of this, business must match stakeholder requirements to provide material information that stands up to scrutiny and presented in a coherent, engaging format.At Sustainability Reporting Europe 2023, a part of IMPACT Congress London, we will help you understand how  to utilise systems and processes to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable data in an automated fashion, explore how sustainability can work closer and more effectively together with finance, risk, and legal teams, and how businesses can meet regulatory requirements while not losing sight of the ‘why’ we report.F﻿or more event information, visit the official website here: https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/reporting-europe?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_campaign=5912"
