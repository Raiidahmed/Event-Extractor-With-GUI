Years ago, the Cowan family decided that self-sufficiency and the ability to grow their own food was paramount to a truly healthy way of life. They began to learn everything they could about the principles of Permaculture and endeavored to build their Food Forest/Urban Farm. As a family, they designed these gardens as a study in efficiency and sustainability, limited only by the size of their city lot. Every year, the family rethinks their gardens and dreams up ways to incorporate and grow additional varieties with greater volumes of food plants. Valley Growing Gardens is all Organic and has not sprayed or been treated for any pests or diseases since its inception. They continue to work with Nature to encourage a wholesome balance in Harmony with the earth. The family wants to encourage people to listen to Nature and build gardens for the future in an Earth-Friendly and Sustainable way. We develop and produce our own compost. We will be teaching and helping others to garden/farm regeneratively by bringing life back into our soils. Without good healthy soil, there will be no food! Mother Earth is sending out an S.O.S and we want to help. We can help you learn how to garden regeneratively and how to help to sequester more carbon into the soil. Life is soil and soil is Life. The most important take-away from this humble valley garden is that no matter whether you live on acres of land or in a small apartment, you can grow good, Organic Food. In this class you will tour the gardens and be thought the principles of growing organically while working with nature.

You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals. ANYONE CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER, BUT BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE JOURNALING PRACTICE THAT'S FUN REQUIRES CONSISTENCY. Are you ready to explore what journaling that celebrates yourself could look and feel like for you? Sign up today, check your email for details, and arrive ready to go all in! I can't wait to connect with you. ~ Claire"

In a single hour, the amount of power from the sun that strikes the Earth is more than the entire world consumes in a year.
“Solar Punk” is the festival theme, which envisions a future where community and technology are integrated to create a self-sustaining system. In this event, attendees will learn about alternative self-sustaining ways to work and power their daily lives. It is an iconic one-day event that celebrates the best of Burien and empowers the community by bringing eco-friendly businesses together to showcase what they do and connect them to the community as potential employers. Business, Arts, and Culture are the three most powerful drivers of community participation and engagement in Burien and the pillars upon which the festival is based. The proceeds from The Burien Solar Punk Festival will be utilized to support: Key Tech Labs Green Jobs Expo, a Mini Job’s Fair, a Small Business Expo, funds for the new micro solar system, and stipends for the youth Green Pre-Apprenticeship Program 
At this year’s Burien Solar Punk Festival you will see green technologies, Like an air-to-water generator, that creates clean drinking water out of the air. You will also see a microgrid solar system that generates energy from sunlight. We even have a farmbot which is an open-source CNC machine that will weed, water, and seed a garden bed all by itself.

There are four key elements to this event occurring simultaneously throughout the day.Pop-up Farmer’s Market: community members will be able to walk through and visit booths housing tech, local green businesses and food. Green Jobs Expo: local green businesses in the solar energy, green construction, and rainwater harvesting industries.  These business owners will be available to speak directly with the community members on what green business is and what it's like to be black in these industries.  These Green entrepreneurs will also share upcoming employment opportunities in which community members can interview on-site.  Music Festival: occurs after the Green Jobs Expo. This centers around the stage where some spoken word artists, a band and some other media attractions will entertain guests. Movie in the Garden Showing of Black Panther: Black Panther is the perfect representation of Solar Punk as it demonstrates cultural use of technology.  Black Panther also showcases a sustainable use of technology in a merger and collaboration between our technological environment and culture.
