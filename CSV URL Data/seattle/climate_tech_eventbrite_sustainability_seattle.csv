You are welcome here! You will register the same as everyone else, participate the same as everyone else. You will simply decline a testing spot after the weekend's general coursework.Not a Coach?Yes, you are still in the right room! Every portion of the coaching sections will apply directly to your personal practice. You will learn an immense amount from this portion of the material, and we look forward to hearing your shock as to how significantly it enhanced your technique and led to your rapid progression moving forward. It won't be the first time!Welcome to DV8.Perpetually enhanced material, never stagnant and never repackaged from anywhere else—DV8 operates on a platform that is truly educationally incentivized, toward continuing education. A truly mixed modality approach to training practice, for self and students. Consistent, replicable results. And a true teaching certification.TEAMS — A vital concept to stability and sustainability: When corporate politics are set aside in industry, we affirm education, community ancellence. A more difficult path, requiring an enhanced level of discipline and Strength of the individual and group.“Though an age old adage, the importance of how we educate ourselves becomes increasingly more clear in the modern day. We are, and we continue to become, that with which we surround ourselves.” — DV8TechniqueEnduranceAptitude inMovement &StrengthDV8 Practice & Teaching CoursesThe most affordable option on the market, with continued accolades in premier quality. How?  Student experience is our bottom line.DV8 Methods, Strength and MovementDV8 Coursework introduces Phil Scarito’s method of modeling and teaching Strength Instruction: from Kettlebells to Bodyweight, Indian Clubs to Barbell. Though students  certify in one particular modality  in a given Certification, they  learn that modality—and learn  to hone and teach that modality—through a mixed modality approach. With many years of attempting to bring this concept to other organizations with which he was associated that were not receptive, it maintains its home at DV8. Think of it as a University, one that offers you a major with built-in, accompanying minors to help you forge your success. This  application is aimed at, and suited to, teaching all learners—from those in the certification space, to those who would learn from them.LESS DRILLS, MORE GET-IT-RIGHT-FROM-THE-STARTWe have all but eliminated the frustration that most Students face when learning a new skill, and we have made it easy for not only athletes and general population to practice it, but for coaches and instructors to teach it. Less drills, more get-it-right-from-the-start instruction. And where progressions are required, we prefer progressions to train the skills, progressions that are strengthening methods themselves, as opposed to crutches or training wheel type approaches that must be trained out of eventually.Our approach to Strength, from values to the physical, is revolutionary.January 2024, join us for the DV8:Kettlebell Practice & Teaching Certification CourseKettlebell Movements The Deadlift, Swing, Clean, Snatch, Front Squat and Half Wedge GU (Get-Up) will be tested*, using the DV8 concepts taught throughout the weekend. *The entire Get-up will be taughtTested as follows:Deadlift - Double bells 5 Reps/Single bell 5R/5LClean - Double bells 5 Reps/Single bell 5R/5LSnatch- Single bell 5R/5LSwing - Double bells 5reps/Single bell 5R/5LFront Squat - Double bells 5reps/Single bell 5R/5LHalf Wedge GU (Get-Up) - 3R/3LBell sizes will vary based on movement tested, and technique tests will not be by bell weight. It will be up to the student to make smart choices during testing that gives them the best chance to demonstrate the skills above. Just as we should be coaching our students in the real-life training enviroment. Each DV8 Cert student should be able to execute the movement according to the DV8 system taught and practiced throughout the weekend, which is then also tested. Note that not all certifying courses through other kettlebell certification organizations require you to actually test out the teaching skill, or have a consistent portion of thier curriculum dedicated to the skill of teaching itself, but they will hand you a teaching certificate nonethless if you can complete personal skills testing to their liking. If this is what you want, we are not the organization for you. More in the TEACHING section a few paragraphs below.Indian Clubs ComponentIntegrating other tools such as the Indian Club gives the participant a proven way to improve shoulder mobility, posture, while adding a new movement assessment and teaching how to truly go from tension to relaxation during training session.3 fundamental patterns will be taught, not tested. Bodyweight ComponentThe DV8 system of teaching introduces cues and concepts that will make immediate changes and improve the participants Push-Up and Scarito’s One Arm Wedge Pushup. The student will be tested on the Classic Push-Up (5 reps).What is a Push-Up by DV8 standards? Neck neutral, slightly extended; solid hollow position held throughout the movement; heels behind the toes; feet shoulder width apart; elbows slightly angled towards the ribs.The DV8 One Arm Wedge Push-Up is taught, not tested.Strength & Endurance ChallengeClean to Push Press with a Re-Clean after each rep — 20 reps (Cannot put bells down.)Objective: Clean bells into Rack. The student will proceed to Push Press the bells into an overhead lockout position, the heels can come up or stay down and the student can either lower the bells into the rack or let them be absorbed by a knee dip. After each Push Press there must be a  re-clean.  Bells cannot be put down, only a rest in Rack position is allowed during testing. A knee bend must be present during each rep and no strict presses will be allowed. There is no time limit. Kettlebell Test Weight: Students will determine their bell size prior to Certification weekend in order to train for the test safely and appropriately.To do so, determine your 5 Rep Max Double Kettlebell Military Press. Then go one bell size down from your max, and these will be the bells you test with. For example, a Student presses double 28k's for 5, their test bell will be 24k. Another example: a Student presses 16k's for 5, so their test bell will be 14k. If Your Strength & Endurance test bell weight increases with your training, prior to Event weekend, allow this benefit and be proud of your progress.(We will test your five rep max at the start of the weekend.)TEACHINGIt's one thing to be tested on performance and skills, but what makes an Instructor/Coach most impactful to their students is the ability to interact with their students.  We will instruct and test each participant on their ability to take the DV8 guidelines and apply these guidelines  in various situations throughout the entire weekend.PRESENTATION SKILLSYour education includes the specifics of how to instruct and coach individuals and groups. *Presentation skills are covered as well.*TEACHING TESTINGDuring testing, students must demonstrate they understand and are able to effectively practice the DV8 guidelines, concepts, and instruction tactics. These will be taught and practiced during the weekend and tested on Sunday, the 28th along with the skills and C&PP test.Students will also leave the weekend with easily used in-hand tools to continue to practice after the weekend and well beyond testing.TRULY REPLICABLEMethods and results are replicable and easily identifiable; people will be able to identify from where you learned to practice and teach, and where their teacher (you, as the Coach of other Students) learned to practice and teach. The mark of a true teaching discipline, this removes the issue of movements and teaching practices not being consistent, a concern you’ve perhaps experienced or witnessed elsewhere in the past.QuestionsAlways welcome. Please contact phil@dv8fitness.com directly with any and all questions, or on IG @philscarito  @dv8fitness#daretodv8 #dv8certified See you In-Person in January 2024!* Bonus Workshop: Tuition to this event includes a 3-Hour Troubleshooting workshop Sunday January 28th  aimed at troubleshooting any movement, any method, any modality. Students can come prepared with case studies they cannot crack in their own practice or that of their students, for guaranteed technique corrections, uncovered in real time. Scarito has been tweaking cracks in methods and modalites for decades, to make them as effective as possible where he was unable to fundamentally alter material at organizations having him in to instruct. Those who are aware, are aware. Those who are not can reap the benefit here. These tools for your toolbox will be priceless, and he currently offers no other course like this.———DV8Fitness, Inc reserves the right to deny service at its own discretion.No refunds.

They hid her illness for four years, fearing her children would suffer stigma and discrimination often experienced in the early days of the disease.Her diagnosis began a path of advocacy, faith, and positivity despite her life's detour. Now, Julie advocates for better healthcare outcomes for women through the personal stories and reflections from her life. Her health journey creates space for those walking through their own family or medical crises to be seen and supported.Julie Lewis is a 39-­year AIDS survivor, and mother to Grammy Award winning music producer, Ryan Lewis. She was infected with HIV in 1984 but not diagnosed until the early 1990s when she was given three to five years to live. After years of silence about her disease, she found an unlikely community of friends to fight alongside and began using her story to make a difference. Her experiences as a woman living with AIDS offers insights about grief and loss, caregiving, spirituality and the importance of community in the midst of tragedy.About Third Place BooksFounded in 1998 in Lake Forest Park, Washington, Third Place Books is dedicated to the creation of a community around books and the ideas inside them.

In a single hour, the amount of power from the sun that strikes the Earth is more than the entire world consumes in a year.
“Solar Punk” is the festival theme, which envisions a future where community and technology are integrated to create a self-sustaining system. In this event, attendees will learn about alternative self-sustaining ways to work and power their daily lives. It is an iconic one-day event that celebrates the best of Burien and empowers the community by bringing eco-friendly businesses together to showcase what they do and connect them to the community as potential employers. Business, Arts, and Culture are the three most powerful drivers of community participation and engagement in Burien and the pillars upon which the festival is based. The proceeds from The Burien Solar Punk Festival will be utilized to support: Key Tech Labs Green Jobs Expo, a Mini Job’s Fair, a Small Business Expo, funds for the new micro solar system, and stipends for the youth Green Pre-Apprenticeship Program 
At this year’s Burien Solar Punk Festival you will see green technologies, Like an air-to-water generator, that creates clean drinking water out of the air. You will also see a microgrid solar system that generates energy from sunlight. We even have a farmbot which is an open-source CNC machine that will weed, water, and seed a garden bed all by itself. The future is now and the future is green.

To learn more about Key Tech Labs visit www.keytechlabs.orgThe Burien Solar Punk Festival is an iconic one-day event that aims to celebrate the best of Burien and empower the community by bringing people together in one place to showcase their businesses, connect jobseekers with green companies and professional opportunities. There are few opportunities in Burien where BIPOC (Black, Ingenuous , People of Color) people and businesses can sit down, connect, network, and celebrate the culture together. Join us for a full day of engagement, networking and an evening opportunity to  camp under the stars, watch a culturally relevant movie and enjoy everything from locally crafted beer to AR Art wall or even drink harvested rainwater. The Burien Solar Punk Festival is a Key Tech Labs event seeking to bring technology, art, culture and community together in one place to teach us what the future could look like.We are recruiting volunteers to manage this futuristic event at the following link.  There are four key elements to this event occurring simultaneously throughout the day.Pop-up Farmer’s Market: community members will be able to walk through and visit booths housing tech, local green businesses and food. Green Jobs Expo: local green businesses in the solar energy, green construction, and rainwater harvesting industries.  These business owners will be available to speak directly with the community members on what green business is and what it's like to be black in these industries.  These Green entrepreneurs will also share upcoming employment opportunities in which community members can interview on-site.  Music Festival: occurs after the Green Jobs Expo. This centers around the stage where some spoken word artists, a band and some other media attractions will entertain guests. Movie in the Garden Showing of Black Panther: Black Panther is the perfect representation of Solar Punk as it demonstrates cultural use of technology.  Black Panther also showcases a sustainable use of technology in a merger and collaboration between our technological environment and culture.  This film is nostalgic in the heart of the BIPOC Community, as it showcases Black representation within Hollywood.For more info about the event and all that will be taking place during the event visit the event webpage at www.TheBuriensolarpunkfestival.org"
