The Balance of Energy between all thingsLocated on a historic farm estate, Orenda winery blends rustic-charm with classic-elegance. Orenda is the perfect location for your event.Orenda Winery brought together three friends with a shared commitment—to build community and to bring Orenda to winemaking. We believe wine should maintain a balance between bold and subtle flavors. To execute this vision, we have partnered with some of the highest elevation vineyards in Washington state in both Yakima Valley and Columbia Valley. High elevation provides a cool climate with late ripening fruit. This allows the grapes more time to mature, making wine less bold and significantly more subtle than wines from warmer regions. When aged in small French oak barrels, the results are complex, dynamic flavors reminiscent of an old-world style rarely found in Washington wines."

Registration is required in advance.About The Language of Water. . .The dawn of the twenty-second century finds women in a new world where water ---the lack of it, or the over-abundance of it—shapes their inner and outer lives. Sara turns eighteen and longs to join the all-women’s Kurdish army to wrestle control of the headwaters of the Euphrates River from the grip of Turkiye’s first woman President, calling who calls herself “Ataturka.” These two women share a common enemy that has infected the globe: climate despair. And yet, in the darkest hour there is cause for hope. A new technology born of the secret substances of the Earth, could transform the planet. Only the power structures of humanity stands in the way. Can Sara and Ataturka help one another create a new form of power defined by the depth and scope of their hearts, or will the Water War bitterly divide them? Will their passion for life, for love, for a world where all living things can flourish pull them down into the darkest cavern of the human soul, or catapult them to the stars?Elizabeth Clark-Stern grew up writing stories and plays, which ultimately led to a career as a television screenwriter. Her produced credits include the critically acclaimed All I Could See from Where I Stood (PBS), Having Babies II (ABC), and Help Wanted (CBS), the latter nominated for an Emmy. She is particularly proud of an independent documentary, Home from the Eastern Sea, which she wrote and co-produced with an all-female creative team. The film was honored with a NAFTA American Scene Award, and a Cine Golden Eagle. In tandem with screenwriting, she worked on novels, drawn to the duel reality of inner and outer life. This eventually led to a new calling as a psychotherapist. She worked with the most vulnerable populations, seeing first-hand the tragic impact of class, race, gender, and mental health inequality. This work brought her writing to a whole new level, a world of symbols and archetypal forces not limited to the conventions of time and space. She was presented with an Achievement in the Arts Award from the Seattle Psychoanalytic Community for producing and publishing four plays and Soul Stories, a collection of two novellas. Elizabeth’s dearest treasure is her loving and laughing family.Nisi Shawl is the author and editor of over a dozen books of speculative fiction and related nonfiction, including the Nebula Award finalist novel Everfair, two volumes of the Locus, FIYAH, and World Fantasy Award-winning New Suns anthology series, and their first story collection Filter House, published by Aqueduct Press in 2008 and co-winner of the 2009 Otherwise Award. Our Fruiting Bodies is Aqueduct’s newest collection of Shawl’s enticingly weird work.About Third Place BooksFounded in 1998 in Lake Forest Park, Washington, Third Place Books is dedicated to the creation of a community around books and the ideas inside them.

In this course, participants explore the theory and practice of democracy as it relates to our practice as educators. Through this exploration course members link democratic & educational theory to our practice as educators. Grads think about and work to understand politics, justice, democracy, and other powered concepts in the context of education and use our own experiences in conjunction with contemporary and historical case studies as tools for reflection & deliberation to make sure that the vision of democratic education we create is grounded in felt experience.  The essential question of the course is “What is Democratic Education and what is our/my role in that?” explored through the goods held in tension within a democracy.Climate Change, Climate Justice & Emotionality taught by Renée Comesotti: What does it mean to be a child in the Anthropocene–or a teacher? This course is about teaching and learning in a time of climate crisis, with an explicit goal of realizing education for justice and action.  The course starts by looking inward to how knowledge, emotionality and connection (or the lack of these) shape grads personal response to anthropogenic climate change. Grads investigate some of the myriad ways that climate injustice intersects with and feeds historic and systemic injustices, and consider the implications for education and action. The course explores how Indigenous and other epistemologies may offer solutions to our current crises in education and climate and challenge the limitations and injustices of Western knowledge systems. Grads assemble toolkits of powerful, practical strategies and approaches for building students’ literacies in environmental science, climate and climate justice, and leverage combined insights and expertise to imagine and enact learning experiences to support students' empowerment as change agents within their communities. And above all the course challenges members to find ways to foster resilience, efficacy and justified hopefulness for our students and ourselves.Qualitative Research Methods taught by Dr. Déana Scipio: This workshop-style course introduces grads to different qualitative research methods in educational research, provides a context for workshopping final products e.g. exams, projects, etc., and builds grads' understanding of qualitative research methodologies by giving them opportunities to interact directly with researchers. Through a combination of readings, mini lectures, discussions, visitors, and class exercises, grads will be introduced to qualitative research concepts, theories, and practices. Grads will use the methodological text Qualitative Research: Bridging the Conceptual, Theoretical, and Methodological (Ravitch & Carl, 2021) as their central textbook. Grads will read additional empirical pieces by multiple critical scholars and educational researchers. Advanced Instructional Strategies taught by Ray Cramer: This workshop class provides opportunities for action research among graduate instructors seeking to apply and refine their practice across a wide variety of educational settings. Students are refining their behavior management; assessment of prior knowledge and new learning; and engagement of students in their learning activities.  They do this in many ways, including: submitting an article on a teaching technique for publication, practicing observing and providing feedback with a peer, and evaluating student learning through videos, observations and student work. Please register to learn from and with the IslandWood EEC 2023 Graduate Class from where ever you may be in the world!

Stay on a monastic diet of swings and get-ups, slowly chipping away at “Sinister.” Or try something “same but different”: the snatch plus the clean and military press, the classic Rite of Passage.The Snatch is “the Tsar of the kettlebell lifts.” Thanks to more muscles working and twice the distance travelled, it accomplishes even more than the esteemed swing. Achieve total body explosive power, ruthless conditioning, and a vice like grip. Burn fat like never before. All with a lighter kettlebell—save space in your home, car trunk, or deployment kit.Once we have taught you the skills with our usual attention to detail, we will send you off to succeed with a Strong Endurance™ snatch plan.The one-arm Clean-and-Press will rival any other pressing exercise when it comes to shoulder strength and muscular development. It is untouchable when it comes to shoulder health, thanks to its ergonomic perfection.The military press comes equipped with the “Rite of Passage” type programming—possibly the most reliable progression ever.Three versions of the ROP—“Jurassic,” “907 Hypertrophy,” and “Heavy”—will keep you gaining for a long time.Kettlebell 201 ROP sets high goals—and gives you the skills and the roadmap to reach them.Whether you are on the road to achieving your StrongFirst Instructor certification, or are working on owning the requisite skills to train intelligently as an avid enthusiast...Do you have what it takes?Sign up and power to you!"
