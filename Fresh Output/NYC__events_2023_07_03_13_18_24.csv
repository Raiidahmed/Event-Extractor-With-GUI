O﻿n day one, we will begin with a quick material & joinery discussion to foreground our cabinet-making, covering uses for hardwood vs plywood, and tongue / groove / rabbet 101s. We will then move into machine safety & set up for dimensioning & grooving our face frame parts. With our groove made, we will set up for putting a tongue on our plywood parts, testing for accuracy with both feel and measurements. We will have all cabinet parts cut & joinery completed, and will have covered the jointer, planer, router table & table saw with dado stack on day one.At the beginning of day two, we will begin by combining cabinet parts, learning about best glue up practices along the way, and then begin hand-sketching our cabinets to build, with dropped-down dimensions. Participants are encouraged to consider a space in their homes or offices for this small cabinet to live, and design accordingly. When ready, we'll begin cutting down our cabinet parts to final dimension, marking for through and pilot holes, and finish by screwing them together. By then end of our second day, we will have covered proper form with clamps, gluing & drills (screwguns), as well as further table saw practice. This is a great class for those new to woodworking, or those interested in brushing up on their essentials skills in a safe, supportive environment. While geared towards those who have used some (though perhaps not all) of these machines or processes before, beginners eager to dive right in are absolutely welcome. We will be moving at a quick pace, and any and all questions are greatly encouraged, especially the ones we’ve been taught to think we should already know the answer to.This class is welcoming to all, especially those traditionally underrepresented in the field of woodworking- in particular those who identify as female, trans*, non-binary & gender non-conforming, BIPOC, queer, disabled.

Through myth making and tool use, they facilitate small groups in building bridges from land to sea, imagining sustainable ecologies.Tree/ Tree.ceo is the performance art and design project of Ana Vásquez, in which she appropriates means of performance marketing to co-create regenerative loops and funnels that supplant cultural erasure. Informed by her practice as an Emergent Strategy facilitator, new media artist, and brand designer, her Dominican background serves as a starting point for stoking Pre-Columbian collective memory. She employs soft power to explore intersectional myth-making and tool-building for lush ecosystems.Jennae “Oyster” Santos is a music and performance artist and Babaylanic student born in the Bay Area (Ohlone territory) and based in Brooklyn (Lenapehoking territory), with ancestral roots across the Philippines archipelago. In infinite collaborative incarnations, she helms progressive art rock project gushes— songwriting and composition rooted in rhythmic guitar loops and ritualized theatre with a stylistic range encompassing chamber rock ensemble, experimental drone, movement cycle, sound sculpture, and more. Santos’ work is influenced by Indigenous Filipino psychology, Kali as a decolonized combat art, the feminist occult, plant medicine and ecology, BIPOC land revolution movements, genderqueer fluidity, and pleasure autonomy.With the aim to cultivate space for collective trust and shared dreaming, Tree+Oyster arrive with non verbal communication and play to shed anthropocentric perspective and facilitate opportunities for emergent ritual.Tree+Oyster merge archipelagic Indigenous mythologies from the Dominican Republic and the Philippines in order to stoke memory, resist erasure, and generate new mythologies. We are curious to discover cross-cultural parallels in land-water relationship between Indigenous communities and our own personal decolonization research. We engage in immersive research deepening our relationship to land and community. From this foundation, we facilitate creative gatherings bridging inner and outer ecologies — a practice in tuning our personal, communal, and digital relationship to the landscape.Site-specific gatherings consist of co-creation exercises and games, sensorial ceremonies, body mapping, collective altar building, and musical forest jams. Seasonal elements, i.e. sand, snow, and vegetation, inform the location and structure of interactive installations. These onsite activations create a generative mediated space for communal storytelling.Rooted in the study of Indigenous histories, local-to-global community, and ecology, Tree+Oyster aims to build a cross-cultural campfire generating warmth, in empathetic pursuit of sustainability.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/flux-factory-66821397293

It was only in the year 2000 they started to remember who they really are through communing with their sacred medicine nixi pae (ayahuasca) within their community. Their identity has since returned after more than the 20 years of prayers and cultural strengthening undertaken by the spiritual leader Ninawá Pai da Mata and his village Novo Futuro, and the communities along the Humaitá River. Through this film, we are guided by the villagers through the enchanting cacophony of the forest, understanding the significance of culture and identity to the Huni Kuin people. Speakers: Lara Jacoski is a documentarist, co-director of Bem-te-vi Produções together with Patrick Belem, a 10 years Brazilian independent film production company making collaborations across the 5 continents (AF/AS/EU/NAM/LATAM). Lara has deepened her work in ethnographic projects focused to register culture referring to ancestral knowledge. For the past years she has focused to learn and work with the first nations in Brazil such as Guarani, Yawalapiti, Xavante, Kuikuro, Karajá and Huni Kui which she has recently finished the feature and 6 years project “Eskawata Kayawainvited for a US premiere at the PS2023 MAPS Conference. Such coexistence with the peoples has changed her life and ways of perceiving reality bringing a whole different level of her work. Her current project ""Living Libraries"" is an ongoing series to register traditional people's wisdom from Brazil and beyond.S﻿peakers: Joseph Mays received his MSc in Ethnobotany from the University of Kent researching responses to globalization by the Yanesha of central Peru. Graduating with biology and anthropology degrees from Virginia Commonwealth University, he published a medicinal plant guide for the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve in the Ecuadorian cloud forest. Joseph also holds a certificate in Psychedelic Assisted Therapies from Naropa University, and his conservation work explores how cultural-conditioning influences approaches to biocultural sustainability. His Indigenous rights advocacy stresses the importance of ground-up structures that emphasize local agency and challenge conventional philanthropic models in attempts to support Indigenous autonomy and biodiversity. Joseph is Program Director of Chacruna’s  Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative  (IRI), where he partners with Indigenous community organizations throughout the Americas to support Chacruna’s mission of increasing cultural reciprocity in the psychedelic space, raising unconditional funding and engaging with local stakeholders on their own terms.[﻿Main Credits] Director : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemD.O.P : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemIn association with: Ninawá Pai da Mata and Txai Vinícius Yube Ika Ni BaiProduction: Bem-te-vi ProduçoesCo-Producer : Joakim Vocke Hauge (Hinterland)Executive producer: Oona Chaplin (Double Rainbow Productions), Torstein Grude (Piraya), Alex Moreno (Cine-Creative Media)Co-executive producers: Lucía Alonso, Bodhi Kaya, Coco Amos and Kristen NicoleSound: Origens Sound Farm – Andreia FreireM﻿usic: The Huni Kuin PeopleMain cast: Ninawá Pai Da Mata, Ikamuru Huni Kuin, Yube Dua Bake, Txana Tuwe, Dua Buse Dua Bake / Huni Kuin indigenous people.This work received grants from the Brazilian Show Me The Fund (powered by Brazilian Content, Cinema do Brasil, Projeto Paradiso) plus a 2 years support of international collective funding.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/lara-jacoski-amp-brooklyn-psychedelic-society-67325118833

Its mission is to restore oyster reefs to New York Harbor through public education initiatives in order to create a future in which New York Harbor is the center of a rich, diverse, and abundant estuary. Oysters have a remarkable ability to filter nitrogen pollution from water as they eat, earning them the nickname “ecosystem engineers” because we see biodiversity levels increase dramatically surrounding oyster reefs, and the belief is that restoring oysters and reefs will, over time, restore the local marine ecosystem’s natural mechanisms for maintaining itself, resulting in cleaner water and greater biodiversity.Testimonials""Montana was an excellent tour guide I learned a lot"" -Richard""I liked everything, interesting, educational and fun"" -Kathleen""Great all around activity."" -Ben""﻿Access to & information about a place in NYC that was something I didn't know much about"" -Adrienne""﻿Educational: How oysters can help clean environment.

Tackling these emissions is critical if we are to make Net Zero a reality, and while large corporates are setting Scope 3 targets and committing to decarbonizing their value chains, many businesses are still struggling to take action.Scope 3 emissions are by nature a collective challenge, and a complex one. Getting  answers and solutions to achieve Scope 3 emission reductions and credibly report on the impact achieved is an absolute priority, and it has been a key focus of the Value Change Initiative since 2017. Since then, we have focused on making Scope 3 operationable trough the implementation of Market Based Mechanisms. On September 20, join us for Climate Week’s premier Scope 3 event. Together with leading experts and companies, let’s explore and discuss solutions to accelerate action when traceability is imperfect, enable collaboration and partnerships, and make Net Zero value chains a reality in today’s Scope 3 landscape.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/value-change-initiative-46407352313

These problems are compounded by climate change, which causes issues such as reduced habitable space and deepened inequality. However, city planners can build resilience into their communities by leveraging new management techniques and smart technologies to improve livability.

Small and medium-sized cities account for more than half of the global urban population, and they continue to exhibit significant growth. To accommodate everyone, city authorities must prioritize sustainable development with a focus on inclusivity, safety, affordability, and resilience. They must also integrate infrastructure investments and policy reforms into their plans. Fortunately, new digital technologies aid decision-making and enable transparent, people-centered, and accountable governance in smart cities. However, the financing gap remains significant in developing countries. Thus, authorities should leverage resources and create economic opportunities to narrow the gap.

In response to SDG7, SDG9, SDG11, and SDG17, this side event shares best practices on smart and sustainable policy reform, digital development, climate resilience, modern waste management and health system design, and financing strategies. Audience members will learn more about key factors that enhance livability and resilience for all citizens, as well as how city authorities, companies, and community partners can build smarter and more sustainable cities together.

It's the story of one enormous tuna and the dedicated fisherman who first tagged her. Dubbed Amelia (for her transatlantic journey), this fish was first caught off the New England coast by an enigmatic man named Al Anderson. Though a lifelong professional fisherman, Anderson did not see fish simply as a means to a paycheck. Rather, he understood that his own livelihood depended on that of the fish he caught. In riveting detail, Pinchin follows the story of how Al's obsession - he tagged over 60,000 fish in his lifetime -  made him just as many enemies as it did friends, as he existed in the unique and often tense space between a booming bluefin tuna industry and science-fueled conservation efforts. Kings of Their Own Ocean is an urgent investigation that combines science, business, and social justice. Through this lens, readers will come to understand the horrible effects that climate change and over-fishing are having on our oceans. If we don’t understand how tuna live, breed, and move around, especially in this era of increasing climate change, then we run the risk of watching them vanish like Atlantic cod and wild Atlantic Salmon. As Pinchin writes, “Now is the moment when we will get to choose whether we want to live in a world with tuna — or not.”Karen Pinchin is an award-winning investigative journalist and culinary school graduate. A recent Tow Fellow at PBS's Frontline, she graduated from Columbia Journalism School with a Master of Arts in science journalism and has since been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Sloan Foundation.

Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right.

Dr. Jardetzky's broad scope of scientific interests also included celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, theoretical physics, seismology, and the migration of the poles. A principal contribution to science was his mathematical theory on zonal rotation, which provided a mechanism for the migration of continents.
The Jardetzky lecture was established in 1992 by Dr. Jardetzky's son Oleg, who was the founder of the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and professor of molecular pharmacology at Stanford University. In endowing the lectureship, Dr. Jardetzky said he hoped it would ""help enrich the outstanding tradition of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which provided a much cherished intellectual home to my father after he emigrated to this country.""
