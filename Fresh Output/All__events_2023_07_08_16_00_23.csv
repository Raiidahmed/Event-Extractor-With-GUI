This is the seventh Silicon Valley Foresight Four Seminar Series featuring solutions to advance the goal of a sustainable future with Net Zero emissions by 2050. Innovation in Materials for the Circular EconomyThe goal of the Circular Economy is to solve problems including climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. This can be accomplished by stepping back from the conventional approach for how we make things today to inventing new materials, methods and designs that plan ahead for using non-toxic ingredients to make the products we use every day and to design them so that they can be recovered and reused or deconstructed and reconstructed into new products enabling the materials to be used over and over again, without creating waste.  We will discuss: ➢	What is the circular economy and what are its benefits?➢	Who is innovating in this area and their examples?➢	What are the opportunities for the future of material science?➢	How can we accelerate the transition to circular materials?Additional Information on the Circular Economy:According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation one of the leaders in this field: “In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste – the process is linear. In a circular economy, by contrast, we stop waste being produced in the first place. The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design:●	Eliminate waste and pollution●	Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)●	Regenerate natureIt is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials. A circular economy decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. It is a resilient system that is good for business, people and the environment.”Date:		Monday, August 7, 2023Time:	   5:30 PM - 7:30 PM (Registration and networking begin at 5:00PM)Location: Plug and Play Tech Center, 440 N Wolfe Rd, Sunnyvale, CA 94085Cost:		Free but registration is requiredYou will have an opportunity to network in person to share your thoughts and experiences with peers and to speak in-depth with each of the panelists after the formal presentation, while enjoying refreshments.Agenda:5:00 - 5:30 PM  -Registration, Networking5:30 - 7:00 PM  -Panel Presentations, Q&A7:00 - 7:30 PM -NetworkingSpeakers/Panelists:	Dr. William Tarpeh, Assistant Professor, Chemical Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering, Center Fellow at the Precourt Institute For Energy, and the Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford UniversityJesse Simons, Co-Founder and CCO, SolarcycleGeoff Chapin, CEO, CarbonwaveModerator: Marianna Grossman, Sr. Consultant, USAsia Venture PartnersPanelists and Moderator Bios:Dr. William Tarpeh is an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Stanford University.

Carbonwave’s products help reduce and offset emissions from fossil fuels and traditional plastics, while minimizing waste. Their seaweed derived fertilizers and plant performance boosters help soils and crops overcome challenges from environmental stresses like heatwaves, droughts, and soil exhaustion. They are creating a plant-based fabric that relies on the extraction of structural polymers to form films stronger than the seaweed itself and competitive with the strength of other vegan textiles, without relying on polyurethane (PU) plastic for structure and strength. Their SeaBalance line of broad-spectrum emulsifiers have a wide range of applications across cosmetics and skin-care products. Unlike emulsifiers used in cosmetics and personal health that are often made with harmful fossil fuel derivatives, SeaBalance utilizes an all-natural process to make an emulsifier that’s healthy to use, and healthy for the planet. C-Combinator emulsifiers are versatile by nature: they work with formulations ranging from pH 3.5 to pH 9, and are capable of emulsifying a wide variety of oils between 10% to 40% oil content.Moderator:Marianna Grossman  is Senior Consultant & Advisor on Sustainability, USAsiaVenture Partners and Managing Partner of Minerva Ventures, investing and advising on solutions for a resilient future – bringing people and institutions together across sectors to collaborate, invent, fund and implement solutions that enhance sustainability and reverse climate change.

With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world.

Background Info on the Location:The Spiral Gardens Community Farm differs from other community gardens in that it is one big plot for everyone to plant and work on together, really creating a communal endeavor. The Farm is dedicated to food production, and in contrast to their Nursery and Produce Stand, this food is not for sale. The harvest is shared between the volunteer growers, low-income senior residents in the adjacent apartments, and other neighborhood folks who need it. While they are actively encouraging people in the immediate neighborhood to come work on the farm, anyone is welcome to volunteer, gain skills, and share in the harvest.Community volunteers annually plant and harvest at least one ton of produce. They also test-plant many new varieties of food plants to determine their productivity in our area.",

Chances are good that brown-shingled Arts and Crafts homes quickly come to mind. But modern houses built from the 1940s through the 1970s — and, indeed, still today — make a sizable contribution to some of the most beautiful and, arguably, most mysterious neighborhoods anywhere.
On Wednesday, August 2, at 7 p.m., architecture enthusiast and journalist Dave Weinstein will take us on a photo tour of some of these distinctive homes in Berkeley and beyond, discuss why modernism came late to the Bay Area, and explain why — and with whom — it proved so popular. We’ll also learn how this style, which looks so different from Arts and Crafts buildings, actually is deeply indebted to the Craftsman ethos.
Tickets for this program are $5 for club members and $10 for non-members. Please register early so we can be sure to accommodate everyone comfortably and safely. Masks are strongly encouraged.
For years, Dave has written about Bay Area architecture for the San Francisco Chronicle. His popular books include Signature Architects of the Bay Area, Berkeley Rocks, and It Came from Berkeley: How Berkeley Changed the World. For the past twenty years, his well-researched articles have appeared in CA-Modern magazine, which focuses on the mid-century modern tract homes that the famed developer Joseph Eichler built in the Bay Area, as well as on other topics related to modern design.
Dave also has worked to publicize and preserve the historic and natural landscapes of El Cerrito, where he lives. He is president of the El Cerrito Historical Society and El Cerrito Trail Trekkers. He was instrumental in saving and restoring the Cerrito Theater (now the Rialto Cinemas Cerrito) and in protecting the Madera Open Space by having it added to the city’s Hillside Natural Area.
Dave grew up on Long Island and studied art history at Columbia University and journalism at UC-Berkeley.",

Listen to experts from Gensler, Rheaply, and Kay Chesterfield on how they are putting this concept into practice.Before the panel, we will enjoy refreshments and a terrarium building activity to get to know each other better and practice some creative reuse. In the spirit of circularity, we encourage you to bring a jar, rocks, or fun found-objects, and plant cuttings to share with the group.This year’s WIG theme is “Self-Titled”. We are constantly reinventing ourselves, our careers, and our points of view. As we come out of the pandemic and return to in-person events, what do we want our WIG community to look like? We have the opportunity to define this for ourselves and celebrate all we have been through!

Time Magazine has called her ""Africa's premier diva”, and named her one of the most influential people in the world for 2021; The BBC, Forbes Magazine, and The Guardian have all highlighted her importance to the people of the African continent. She is the recipient of the 2015 Crystal Award given by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the 2016 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award, and the 2018 German Sustainability Award. As a performer, her striking voice, stage presence and fluency in multiple cultures and languages have won respect from her peers and expanded her following across national borders. Kidjo has cross-pollinated the West African traditions of her childhood in Benin with elements of American R&B, funk and jazz, as well as influences from Europe and Latin America.Angelique also advocates on behalf of children as a UNICEF and OXFAM Ambassador. She created her own charitable foundation, Batonga, dedicated to support the education of young girls in Africa.JUPITER & OKWESSExplosive! Na Kozonga, the new album by Jupiter and his band Okwess is a blast of energy that bewitches the body and feeds the spirit. Since the beginning, the Rebel General and his fellow pyrotechnicians have been drawing the rhythms of the Congo out of obscurity to reveal their superpowers: the powers of rock and funk, ready for every kind of musical coupling and any kind of invitation! From Damon Albarn to Money Mark (Beastie Boys) via, on this new album, the samba of Rogê, the rap of Marcelo D2, the horns of New Orleans or the voice of the militant Chilean singer Ana Tijoux. Jupiter & Okwess have no fear of strange encounters, nor the craziest journeys. They’ve even managed to conquer Latin America, and are currently busy recreating the triangular trade, in sounds! No surprise from one who, on his first album, declared “Ich bin ein Congolese...The world is my land.” “We all have ancestors in Africa,” Jupiter reminds us, “and they also played music. And if Africa looks like a revolver, its trigger can be found...in the Congo!’ Ready, Steady, Go! Jupiter and his joyous pistoleros are giving us the go-ahead. A new world tour awaits them.

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator.

Generating over half of the state’s greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state’s transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA’s Climate Roadmap tackles the city’s ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city’s eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation.

Years ago, the Cowan family decided that self-sufficiency and the ability to grow their own food was paramount to a truly healthy way of life. They began to learn everything they could about the principles of Permaculture and endeavored to build their Food Forest/Urban Farm. As a family, they designed these gardens as a study in efficiency and sustainability, limited only by the size of their city lot. Every year, the family rethinks their gardens and dreams up ways to incorporate and grow additional varieties with greater volumes of food plants. Valley Growing Gardens is all Organic and has not sprayed or been treated for any pests or diseases since its inception. They continue to work with Nature to encourage a wholesome balance in Harmony with the earth. The family wants to encourage people to listen to Nature and build gardens for the future in an Earth-Friendly and Sustainable way. We develop and produce our own compost. We will be teaching and helping others to garden/farm regeneratively by bringing life back into our soils. Without good healthy soil, there will be no food! Mother Earth is sending out an S.O.S and we want to help. We can help you learn how to garden regeneratively and how to help to sequester more carbon into the soil. Life is soil and soil is Life. The most important take-away from this humble valley garden is that no matter whether you live on acres of land or in a small apartment, you can grow good, Organic Food. In this class you will tour the gardens and be thought the principles of growing organically while working with nature.  This is a hands on course with uneven ground to walk around as you stroll through the gardens. Please wear appropriate shoes and prepare for our WA weather. This will be a casual talk and questions are welcome. Lets get together and Plant Some Great Healthy Food!",

The proceeds from The Burien Solar Punk Festival will be utilized to support: Key Tech Labs Green Jobs Expo, a Mini Job’s Fair, a Small Business Expo, funds for the new micro solar system, and stipends for the youth Green Pre-Apprenticeship Program 
At this year’s Burien Solar Punk Festival you will see green technologies, Like an air-to-water generator, that creates clean drinking water out of the air. You will also see a microgrid solar system that generates energy from sunlight. We even have a farmbot which is an open-source CNC machine that will weed, water, and seed a garden bed all by itself. The future is now and the future is green.

To learn more about Key Tech Labs visit www.keytechlabs.orgThe Burien Solar Punk Festival is an iconic one-day event that aims to celebrate the best of Burien and empower the community by bringing people together in one place to showcase their businesses, connect jobseekers with green companies and professional opportunities. There are few opportunities in Burien where BIPOC (Black, Ingenuous , People of Color) people and businesses can sit down, connect, network, and celebrate the culture together. Join us for a full day of engagement, networking and an evening opportunity to  camp under the stars, watch a culturally relevant movie and enjoy everything from locally crafted beer to AR Art wall or even drink harvested rainwater. The Burien Solar Punk Festival is a Key Tech Labs event seeking to bring technology, art, culture and community together in one place to teach us what the future could look like.We are recruiting volunteers to manage this futuristic event at the following link.  There are four key elements to this event occurring simultaneously throughout the day.Pop-up Farmer’s Market: community members will be able to walk through and visit booths housing tech, local green businesses and food. Green Jobs Expo: local green businesses in the solar energy, green construction, and rainwater harvesting industries.  These business owners will be available to speak directly with the community members on what green business is and what it's like to be black in these industries.  These Green entrepreneurs will also share upcoming employment opportunities in which community members can interview on-site.  Music Festival: occurs after the Green Jobs Expo. This centers around the stage where some spoken word artists, a band and some other media attractions will entertain guests. Movie in the Garden Showing of Black Panther: Black Panther is the perfect representation of Solar Punk as it demonstrates cultural use of technology.  Black Panther also showcases a sustainable use of technology in a merger and collaboration between our technological environment and culture.  This film is nostalgic in the heart of the BIPOC Community, as it showcases Black representation within Hollywood.For more info about the event and all that will be taking place during the event visit the event webpage at www.TheBuriensolarpunkfestival.org",

Plan for 60 minutes on Sunday, from 12:00-1:00 PM EASTERN.This workshop is for you if: You're naturally everyone else's biggest cheerleader, and you're ready to prioritize being your own.  You need to remember how to make time for yourself. And you've grown accustomed to being on auto-pilot as you tend to the needs of everyone around you.  You're looking for a process that will guide you into a sustainable journaling practice that celebrates you. You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals. ANYONE CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER, BUT BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE JOURNALING PRACTICE THAT'S FUN REQUIRES CONSISTENCY. Are you ready to explore what journaling that celebrates yourself could look and feel like for you? Sign up today, check your email for details, and arrive ready to go all in!

Whether you are an experienced teacher, or new to the teaching profession you will feel excited and motivated for your upcoming school year after participating in this highly immersive and collaborative workshop. Participants will engage in thought-provoking, pertinent experiments, and activities that you can utilize in your own classroom. We will spend time observing instruction from the point of view of a student (“student-mode”), and learn strategies to incorporate in their own classroom using the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework, Social Ecological Systems (SES), transdisciplinary thinking, and panarchy as tools to probe student preconceptions. Periodically, participants will switch to “teacher-mode”, to practice Socratic questioning techniques, analyze readings, and discuss the pedagogical rationale for all aspects of active learning and modeling in Environmental Science. We’ll also discuss strategies for accommodating district-specific curricular requirements, various student populations, laboratory resources, and the use of “Reflective Checklists” as a way of promoting student reflection throughout a unit.The Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science curriculum curriculum blends a humanities-based lens with scientific methods to create a transdisciplinary approach, to empower students to live more sustainable lives. Panarchy transcends the boundaries of scale and discipline. Most importantly, the panarchy model advocates a transition from a static understanding of nature to a dynamic idea that places an emphasis on multiple stable states, resilience, and cross-scale interactions that result in adaptive change. The adaptive cycle –  in its development, deployment, and representation – ties each of the units of the APES curriculum together. So if you’re a high school environmental science teacher wanting to learn some great activities to invigorate your teaching practices or a teacher wanting to learn some notable strategies to improve student discourse then this is the workshop for you!Cost: (Limited # of tickets!)Early Bird $275General Admission Teacher Price $350General Admission School Price $500STEMteachersNYC delivers professional development workshops for teachers, by teachers, about teaching, since 2011.

Through myth making and tool use, they facilitate small groups in building bridges from land to sea, imagining sustainable ecologies.With the aim to cultivate space for collective trust and shared dreaming, Tree+Oyster arrive with non verbal communication and play to shed anthropocentric perspective and facilitate opportunities for emergent ritual.Tree+Oyster merge archipelagic Indigenous mythologies from the Dominican Republic and the Philippines in order to stoke memory, resist erasure, and generate new mythologies. With curiosity to discover cross-cultural parallels in land-water relationship between Indigenous communities and their own personal decolonization research, T+O engage in immersive research deepening their relationship to land and community. From this foundation, they facilitate creative gatherings bridging inner and outer ecologies — a practice in tuning our personal, communal, and digital relationship to the landscape.Site-specific gatherings consist of co-creation exercises and games, sensorial ceremonies, body mapping, collective altar building, and musical forest jams. Seasonal elements, i.e. sand, soil, and vegetation, inform the location and structure of interactive installations. These onsite activations create a generative mediated space for communal storytelling. Rooted in the study of Indigenous histories, local-to-global community, and ecology, Tree+Oyster aim to build a cross-cultural campfire generating warmth, in empathetic pursuit of sustainability.Tree/ Tree.ceo is the performance art and design project of Ana Vásquez, in which she appropriates means of performance marketing to co-create regenerative loops and funnels that supplant cultural erasure.

She employs soft power to explore intersectional myth-making and tool-building for lush ecosystems.Jennae “Oyster” Santos is a music and performance artist and Babaylanic student born in the Bay Area (Ohlone territory) and based in Brooklyn (Lenapehoking territory), with ancestral roots across the Philippines archipelago.

We hope the open conversation will continue throughout the series of programs.Speaker Bios:Venus ChintalaVenus Chintala is an amateur filmmaker who made New York City his home for the past 15 years. He is fascinated by the expressions of life in all beings and tries to capture them for others to see. What started as taking video of a sparrow here and a squirrel there soon started consuming most of his time on the weekends documenting moments of non-human life that mostly go unnoticed by the busy city dwellers. His current film “Seeds of the City” revolves around gardening in the cities, the stories of those who share a passion for growing for reasons that would soon surprise him. Venus is a software engineer by profession. Tobias Fox As Founder and Managing Director of the community-driven, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization Newark Science and Sustainability, Inc and founder and Facilitator of the Newark Community Food System, Tobias A. Fox have demonstrated collaborative leadership on a grassroots level for ten years. Aside from being a writer and having a decade of independent publishing experience, he is a professional organizer, urban farmer, photographer, and coordinator of an annual Sustainable Living Empowerment Conference. Fox also conducts various community events, presentations, and workshops on sustainable living practices and assisted numerous urban farmers and gardeners with the cultivation of their agricultural space. He has also assisted with the planting of nearly 100 trees in low-income communities with high environmental concerns. More recently, Fox has expanded his global outreach into the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Uganda.David Lee David Lee is an ink and watercolor artist who lives and works in New York City. His style is inspired by traditional East Asian watercolor painting, architectural drawings, and illustrations. Through a combination of linework and color, he seeks to honestly render the essence of the environments we inhabit, to give attention to all elements within them. His work also invites people to see how life and meaning carry on amidst the chaotic emergence of a new normal, e.g., climate change impacts, alternative visions. David has a background in architecture and urban planning and works as an environmental planner.Tammy HollowayMs. Tammy Holloway is a Newark, New Jersey native dedicated to advocating for social, political, and economic inclusive development. Finely centered in forward mobility policies that anchor culture, and inclusiveness and improve the quality of life for the greater good, Tammy has demonstrated tenacity to overcome obstacles while simultaneously creating opportunities for others. Tammy values principled leadership, community strength building, and institutional collaboration. “In my opinion, there’s nothing greater than a community discovering what it cares about and then demonstrating the courage to change over and over again.”  In Tammy’s humble approach, community building encompasses education, economic opportunity, inclusiveness, safety, public health, and the overall well-being of individuals and institutions who share common needs, space, or interests. In her role as a Senior Investigator at the New Jersey Office of The Attorney General, Tammy lead advocacy for policy reform that serves both symbolically and operationally as social justice tools. Tammy currently serves towards the mission of securing our nation’s security as a Special Agent “I know that it requires engagement, support, and legislation to create inclusive, new opportunities that enhance communities, business, government effectiveness, and overall quality of life for our prosperous future.” Tammy is committed to extending her public service, organizing, and advocacy initiatives into communities nationwide.

Its mission is to restore oyster reefs to New York Harbor through public education initiatives in order to create a future in which New York Harbor is the center of a rich, diverse, and abundant estuary. Oysters have a remarkable ability to filter nitrogen pollution from water as they eat, earning them the nickname “ecosystem engineers” because we see biodiversity levels increase dramatically surrounding oyster reefs, and the belief is that restoring oysters and reefs will, over time, restore the local marine ecosystem’s natural mechanisms for maintaining itself, resulting in cleaner water and greater biodiversity.Testimonials""Montana was an excellent tour guide I learned a lot"" -Richard""I liked everything, interesting, educational and fun"" -Kathleen""Great all around activity."" -Ben""﻿Access to & information about a place in NYC that was something I didn't know much about"" -Adrienne""﻿Educational: How oysters can help clean environment.

Urbanization, population growth, and climate change have led to challenges with solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal, and has put stress on water resources. This year’s lab investigates the ways that designers, artists, creative technologists, policy makers, activists, and educators are working to deal with these impacts and what projects are being undertaken to mitigate these risks. The statistics outline a worsening situation.Globally the average person generates 1.6 lbs of waste per day and total waste will rise as the world’s population increases. Even as waste treatment methods have improved, a lot of waste ends up in dump sites and only “20 percent of waste is recycled each year” (Alves, 2023). Hazardous waste, which is especially harmful – coming from dyes, metals in batteries and electronics, and solvents – suffers from inadequate household awareness and lack of industry compliance. Clean water and water systems are taken for granted in many parts of society just as many rivers and lakes have “dried up” or have become “too polluted to use” — and it is expected that by 2025, “two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages.” (WWF, 2023).

Jewelry is our lens, with a twin focus on artistry and responsible practice. A focus, we suggest, unique to IAC.All of us, from those upstream in supply chains to those realizing an artistic vision in fine jewelry, must maintain purpose: we must do the work, ever-committed to effecting the change we seek.Thus, conscious of the imperative to balance the needs of current and future generations, we explore varied declarations of purpose and principle on responsible practice and cultural preservation and how to harmonize and operationalize them, taking action, driven by aspiration. We consider new technologies for extraction and sourcing, new mine-to-market models, and new approaches to training, whether the next generation of jewelers or miners. Always with an eye to meeting evolving environmental and climate challenges.Perhaps most fundamentally, we investigate the critical question of what constitutes luxury in an age of responsible practice.During the conference, IAC will present its 6th annual award for Leadership in Responsible Practice and 3rd annual award for Extraordinary Contributions to the Diamond and Jewelry Industries.The conference kicks off with a welcoming reception at Heritage Auctions New York located at 445 Park Avenue with remarks by Roberta Kramer, Vice President, Strategy & Business Development at Heritage.

It therefore focuses on the essential need for a decolonial turn to counter the ramifications of ecological imperialism and bring to the foreground  subjugated voices, hegemonized perspectives, and silenced forms of knowledge. Further, it suggests the prospect of implementing the notion of decolonial ecology, which involves decolonizing the mind, to revive indigenous histories and foster ethical ecological practises that can contribute to the advancement of planetary sustainability.Goutam Karmakar is an NRF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Faculty of Education at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa.

With current industry challenges being significant – record cost of food inflation, staff shortages, record closures in the independent sector, the food service sector is going through some testing times again. And at the same time the IPCC Report recently published has shown collectively we are way behind targets to reduce emissions to avoid global warming of 1.5C. There are significant external targets to meet around Sustainability such as the Government’s Net Zero targets, demand for broader ESG Reporting, and other related regulations to comply with.There are also many messages out there about how businesses need to reduce their emissions, and work towards Net Zero, including using ‘Less but better meat’, mixed messages about how relevant counting carbon emissions is, requirements for consideration of health and calories, and new terms such as ‘regenerative’ being used. With these events, our aim is to bring together key industry sustainable supply chain change agents including Soil Association Organic Certification, The Ethical Butcher, Pasture for Life Assurance, to provide clarity and to help drive solutions to some of the key challenges we face as we all aim to adopt more sustainable supply chains.Event 2 – Sustainable Sourcing Strategies in Hospitality: Finding SolutionsTuesday 23rd May 2023 | 6pm – 9pm The Duke of Cambridge Pub, 30 Saint Peter’s Street, London, England, N1 8JTA workshop seeking potential solutions within sustainable food sourcing in the hospitality sector and how we can and must go further.

– A unified ESG Scoring and measurement framework for stakeholder capitalism that FinTech can comply with, measure and be regulated to delivery capacity.
Background
FinTech SMEs find it challenging to identify methods that best suit them to bridge the gap between unsustainable and sustainable practices. Various ESG frameworks target various industry sectors, but SMEs find it challenging to identify a framework method that best suits them, as they seek to comply with emerging United Kingdom regulations. Led by the WCIT Financial Services Technology Panel, a group of industry experts on ESG, Risk and Sustainability, and post-graduate MSc students of the City, University of London conducted a comparative study of various ESG frameworks, coming up with suggestions for a unified ESG scoring and measuring framework for stakeholder capitalism that can be measured and regulated to deliver capability for FinTech SMEs. The Speakers will present the findings from the study and the recommendations of practical frameworks that assist in the development of business capability in meeting ESG targets and how using the Social Value Capability Improvement Model developed by the WCIT can assist in terms of the recommended frameworks and in terms of its ability to deliver guidance on evaluating an organisation's progress against its own ESG agenda.

Its main aim is to address current global issues and the inevitable role science and new technologies will play in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set up by the United Nations in 2015 as a blueprint for a better, more sustainable future for all. The 17 SDGs were adopted by all UN member states agreeing to work on, among other things, a plan to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve gender equality and avert climate threats by 2030.This interactive augmented reality exhibition was artistically rendered by the renowned Czech graphic designer Pavel Fuksa, drawing from the concept of the successful Czech Innovation Expo which travelled the world presenting Czech scientific discoveries and innovations. The new London exhibition highlights innovations and issues on a European level, reflecting the higher purpose of science with special emphasis on the means needed to implement the ambitious SGDs.How the Exhibition WorksVisitors will see seemingly static outdoor panels with abstract symbols on the walls. After downloading the exhibition app (available free for Android and iOS), they will see the space around them come to life on their devices, allowing them to explore in a fun and unique way a variety of scientific stories and fascinating information about technological innovations contributing to our sustainable future.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [CSRD] has to be incorporated into member state law by 2024, and with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards [ESRS] being adopted in June this year, businesses are scrambling. They need to prepare existing systems and processes or overhaul them completely to produce consistent, comparable, and quality data that is compliant with the regulation. And they need to do this at speed. A lack of clarity as to how the upcoming regulation will impact businesses and what they will be legally obliged to disclose, combined with differing global collection standards and capabilities has meant many are already behind in their preparation for the CSRD. The pressure is building as the risk of not being CSRD compliant increases. On top of this, business must match stakeholder requirements to provide material information that stands up to scrutiny and presented in a coherent, engaging format.At Sustainability Reporting Europe 2023, a part of IMPACT Congress London, we will help you understand how  to utilise systems and processes to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable data in an automated fashion, explore how sustainability can work closer and more effectively together with finance, risk, and legal teams, and how businesses can meet regulatory requirements while not losing sight of the ‘why’ we report.F﻿or more event information, visit the official website here: https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/reporting-europe?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_campaign=5912",

He is an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Practice at USC and teaches AIAA short courses in Sustainable Aviation and Electric Aircraft.
Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:
""Model results indicate that solar geoengineering could offset most climate change...“ – Ken Caldeira, Stanford University, National Academies Workshop June 20, 2023
“An operational SRM [Solar Radiation Modification] deployment is the only known approach that could be deliberately implemented to cool the Earth within a few years” - Bala, Caldeira, et al.

Led by our experienced breathwork facilitator, Yulay Machado.  Relationships play a fundamental role in our lives, but they can be hindered by the scars of abuse and power struggles. It's time to revitalize your connections and heal the wounds that hold you back. In this transformative breathwork workshop, you'll embark on a journey of self-discovery and healing. Through dynamic breathing exercises, you'll release past traumas, shift unhealthy patterns, and cultivate deeper, more authentic bonds.  Embark on a path towards harmonious relationships and a life filled with love and understanding. Whether you're new to breathwork or a seasoned practitioner, all are welcome to join us for this powerful experience. What to Bring:A yoga matWaterWear comfortable clothes (it is an outdoor backyard location, dress accordingly)Avoid eating 30 minutes before BreathworkA journal (optional)Props like a bolster, blankets (optional)About Breathwork:Breathwork is a powerful practice that uses conscious, connected breathing to facilitate deep emotional, physical, and spiritual healing. Through a specific breathing pattern, individuals are able to access altered states of consciousness, release stored trauma and emotions, and tap into their inner wisdom and intuition. This practice is a beautiful tool for self-discovery and growth and has been used for centuries across various spiritual traditions. Breathwork can be done individually or in a group setting and is facilitated by trained practitioners who provide a safe and supportive container for participants to explore and heal.About Yulay:Yulay is a multi-disciplinary holistic therapist having trained in the modalities of ThetaHealing, SACRED ACTIVATIONS, Breathwork, and Integrated Energy Therapy (IET). As a native Colombian, she discovered she had a strong, natural ability to connect with Creator through her ancestral roots and it’s this relationship which allows her to accurately read and shift any situation. Sliding Scale Pricing:The sliding scale model we have chosen for our pricing reflects our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity, embodying the values of equity and community care. It is a beautiful and seamless way for our attendees to align their investment with their current financial reality, honoring both their own journey and the community's journey. We acknowledge that the societal structures we exist within often require means-testing, and we believe that a sliding scale allows for a compassionate and empowering alternative. We trust that those who are able to pay more will do so from a place of generosity and abundance, supporting the sustainability of our events and making it possible for those who need financial support to attend. We invite each person to reflect on their needs and resources and to choose the option that feels most aligned with their values, knowing that each choice contributes to creating a more just and equitable world for all.Nirvana Tier: This reflects the true cost of the class or service. It is the cost that the practitioner would charge all students in the absence of a sliding scale. If you have access to financial security, own property or have personal savings, you would not traditionally qualify for sliding scale services. If you are able to pay for ""wants"" and spend little time worried about securing necessities in your life, you have economic privilege and power in our community. This price is for you.Ascension Tier:This price point is for folks who paying the full cost would prevent them from being able to attend, but who do not honestly find themselves reflected in either descriptions for the highest cost or the lowest. If you are struggling to conquer debt or build savings or move away from paycheck to paycheck living but have access to steady income and are not spending most of your time thinking about meeting basic needs such as food, shelter, medical care, child care, etc., you belong here. If you, however, can ask others for financial support, such as family members, partners, or friends, please consider using those personal resources before you use the resources of the sliding scale and limit opportunities for others.Enchantment Tier: This price point is for folks whose economic circumstances would prevent them from being a part of classes if there was not be a deliberate opportunity made for them to access services at a cost that is reflective of their economic realities. If you struggle to maintain access to needs such as health care, housing, food, child care, and are living paycheck to paycheck or are in significant debt, you belong probably belong here and you deserve a community that honors your price as equal an economic offering as the person who can pay the highest tier. Even when the lower tier is still prohibitive, we will work with folks to offer extended payment plans and other solutions. Please be mindful that if you purchase a price at the lowest end of the scale when you can truthfully afford the higher ticket prices, you are limiting access to those who truly need the gift of financial flexibility. Being honest with yourself and your financial situation when engaging with sliding scale practices grows strong and sustainable communities.Future Offerings:We  host weekly offerings on Thursdays at 7p. Future offerings  include breathwork, cannabis & CBD circles, plant medicine conversations, workshops, community social gatherings, workshops, and much more.These gatherings will be an opportunity to cultivate a sense of community, deepen our spiritual practices, and explore new dimensions of ourselves.Please follow us on instagram @spirituallycuriousco to stay up to date.",

But what is beyond the horizon, and who has walked this path before? APOLAKI: OPERA OF THE SCORCHED EARTH is a new experimental opera by Filipino-American composer Micaela Tobin in collaboration with installation designer Carlo Maghirang and dancer/choreographer Jay Carlon. Continuing her celebration of the pre-colonial mythologies of the Philippines, Tobin’s new work tells the story of Apolaki, the precolonial God of Sun and War, who finds themself lost in a foreign and unfamiliar land (present day Tongva Land/Los Angeles) after being displaced from the Philippines by Spanish colonizers. This opera is a radical meditation on the complex relationships between settler colonialism, migration, and diaspora, and invites the audience to join Apolaki in this immersive pilgrimage, premiering at the historic and storied Zorthian Ranch overlooking the Los Angeles Basin. This piece is the sequel to Tobin’s recent opera-film, “BAKUNAWA: Opera of the Seven Moons” which premiered at REDCAT in May 2021. Incorporating her signature combination of noise, drone, and opera, for this premiere Tobin has recruited experimental percussionist M.A. Harms and electric bass/guitarist Stephen McNeely to create a dramatic and disruptive soundscape that will draw Apolaki and the audience into a portal for Filipinx Liberation in the form of a  large walking-labyrinth, designed by Carlo Maghirang. APOLAKI is a National Performance Network (NPN) Creation & Development Fund Project co-commissioned by Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in partnership with OUTsider Festival, and NPN. The Creation & Development Fund is supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts (a federal agency). For more information, visit www.npnweb.org. Additional support is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the MAP Fund, supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.About the artistsMicaela Tobin is a soprano, sound artist, and teacher based in Los Angeles, CA who specializes in experimental voice and contemporary opera.As a sound artist with a background in opera, Micaela integrates voice and electronics within the genres of noise and drone music. Her work incorporates ritualized gesture and amplified object-symbolism and explores her diasporic identity as a first-generation Filipina-American. Micaela’s vocal practice is based in building connections between the physical voice as a means of empowering one’s ‘inner’ voice and challenging colonial stories and systems. Composing primarily under the moniker “White Boy Scream,” Micaela dissects her operatic and extended vocal techniques through the use of electronics, oscillating between extreme textures of noise, drone, and operatic sound walls. Her most recent full length album, “BAKUNAWA” (Deathbomb Arc) includes elements of sonic ritual, ancient myth, and ancestral memory. Of the album, Steve Smith of The New Yorker Magazine asserts that “opera would do well to pay attention.” The album was ranked #9 Release of 2020 in The Wire Magazine. In May 2021, Micaela premiered the cinematic adaptation of the album through REDCAT, titled “BAKUNAWA: Opera of the Seven Moons.”As an opera composer, Micaela premiered and earned a five-star review for her first original experimental opera, entitled “Unseal Unseam,” at the world’s largest art festival, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, in summer 2016; the work was described as “hypnotic” and “paralyzingly beautiful,” by New Classic LA after its U.S. debut in October 2017. Her most recent opera, “Belarion: A Space Opera” which premiered at the American Legion Center in Pasadena, CA in February 2019, is about the magickal practices of JPL founder Jack Parsons.As a performer, Micaela played the principal role of Coyote in the critically acclaimed opera, SWEET LAND (dir. Yuval Sharon & Canuppa Luger; Comp. Raven Chacon & Du Yun). She also performed with The Industry in their groundbreaking opera, “Hopscotch, a mobile opera for 24 cars (dir. Yuval Sharon).” She has also toured with hip-hop experimentalists clipping. on their 2017 tour with The Flaming Lips. Micaela also appeared as a principal vocalist in the premiere of Ron Athey and Sean Griffith’s automatic opera, “Gifts the Spirit”; and as a soprano soloist alongside Annette Bening in the play “Medea” at UCLALive.Micaela is currently a voice teacher on faculty at the California Institute for the Arts and teaches through her private studio, HOWL SPACE, in Los Angeles, CA.Jay Carlon was born and raised on California’s Central Coast, Carlon’s work is inspired by growing up the youngest of 12 in a Filipino, Catholic, and agricultural migrant-working family.

Predominant expressions of land-based art and environmental activism in the US have historically ignored Indigenous and Latinx contributions, and at the same time, acquiring critical reception or scholarly notice has been tied to the whitewashing of cultural signifiers. These artists and activists preserve ancestral adobe and ecological practices to keep its roots within Indigenous heritage while promoting its inclusion to canonical land-based artworks and also promoting its environmental sustainability in the deserts of the Southwest. Through the creation and care of adobe-based art and ecological infrastructure, they are staging interventions against displacement and a loss of cultural memory caused by settler colonialism and other oppressive regimes of power. This MA thesis exhibition charts how these artists use adobe to create physical and imagined homes of resistance, threading within it a subjective narrative through the ancestral lands of First Nation and Mexican people in the southwestern United States, to reorient future scholarship on land-based art and activism toward its ancestral, Indigenous coordinates--those of community belonging and ecological sustainability. It’s also one component of a larger “Mud Kin” ongoing project that will encompass an archive of interviews and photographs and other interventions that express Indigenous placekeeping, as well as an exhibition, a publication, and an ArchGIS mapping tool.Photo Credits: Photo documentation by Tracy Fenix, Antonito, CO during an adobe-making and clay workshop with artist, Joanna Keane Lopez and earthen architect, Ronald Rael, August 2022.",

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!",

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!",
"On the Front Lines of Race, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (REDI)", Transformational Learning Circles are designed to incorporate the voices of those who are at the forefront of REDI.," Thursday, July 20, 2023, 1:00 PM"," Thursday, July 20, 2023, 4:00 PM"," Baltimore Unity Hall, 1505 Eutaw Place, Baltimore, MD 21217",DC,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/on-the-front-lines-of-race-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-redi-tickets-541527201437,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-living-well-center-17608036459,"On the Front Lines of Race, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (REDI)Disrupting practices and policies that reinforce the power of isms is not for the faint of heart. The philanthropic and business communities are targeting resources in the name of creating equity and improving outcomes for all groups. From corporations and nonprofits to universities and government agencies, many entities have constructed outward-facing equity statements and have directed management to lead the charge of achieving equity. However, frustration remains for those who are on the front lines working to disrupt and dismantle inequities within public health, education, housing, and workforce systems. To this end, Iona Concepts, Inc. has created a menu of Transformational Learning Circles. These sessions are designed to incorporate the voices of those who are at the forefront of this work and responsible for creating and implementing practices that move the needle of change toward progress. These collaborative convenings are iterative and build on the collective experiences of our Brain Trust, a cadre of seasoned practitioners who center liberatory practices and have a track record of executing models that are disrupting structural inequities and violence in organizational systems and communities. Transformational Learning Circles are curated for participants who aim to learn about and achieve sustainable and transferable practices that advance racial justice and healing inside and outside organizational systems and communities. Sessions are held at Baltimore Unity Hall 1505 Eutaw Place, Baltimore, MD 21217 at no cost, yet monetary donations are welcomed. We encourage Baltimore City’s social and public health organizations, social entrepreneurs,  educators, students, and researchers to join us. At the completion of each circle, p﻿articipants will receive a certificate of completion. For registration, we require the completion of this surveyT﻿o get in contact with our team, please reach us at: admin@livewellbemore.comTransformational Learning CirclesConducting Race Equity Audits and BenchmarksThursday, 5/22/23, 1 - 4 pm (date change from original 5/18/22)Funders are tying strings to connect resources by requesting that providers create equity strategies and benchmarks. This process begins with auditing policies, practices, and operational systems. Collecting information for analysis requires a multi-prong approach of reviewing pre-existing data, including the origin story of the institution, human resources data, and conducting key informant surveys and interviews.  This session will explore how this process can create organizational “white water” by triggering racial trauma for people of color and uncovering unconscious biases of supervisors and co-workers. Participants will learn:- Key indicators to facilitate an analysis that focuses on measuring the impact of REDI audits and benchmarking - Learn key strategies to navigate the turbulence of uncovering disparities that are often baked into organizational cultureWhen Race, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (REDI) Create PTSDThursday, 6/15/23, 1- 4 pmPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hidden condition that can be triggered by ongoing experiences with microaggression, discrimination, and retaliation for speaking up and out about inequitable policies, practices, and culture that undermines people who experience discrimination due to class, disability, educational/employment status, ethnicity, gender expression or identity, national origin, race and sexual orientation individually or with intersectionality. This condition can also be triggered when frontline REDI practitioners constantly experience covert, uninformed, and performative efforts without a real destination or plan of action.  This session will explore how Courageous Conversations designed to uncover workplace biases are often fatiguing and can trigger workplace PTSD. Participants will learn how to recognize the conditions of a toxic work environment and learn strategies to support and implement mindfulness within organizational operating norms.Healing the DEI OfficersThursday, 7/20/23, 1-4 pmFacilitating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should/must confront the history and apparatus of racism. DEI practitioners’ bodies become the container for the resistance of shifting power dynamics.  The DEI arena consists of practitioners who were promoted to often ambiguous positions without the benefit of committed leadership and the authority to move the needle of racial equity in policy and practice. This session will explore the restraining forces that take a toll on the economic, emotional, mental well-being of practitioners, and ultimately resulting in physical health challenges and a diminished quality of work life.  Participants will share strategies to cope in toxic environments and will learn ways to leverage healing technologies in the moment to develop a practice of self-care in the workplace.Interior Design Principles for Trauma-Exposed PublicsThursday, 8/17/23, 1-4 pmThe work environment can promote productivity and a healing space for those who work in trauma-exposed environments. Often, social health practitioners are exposed to vicarious trauma as a result of working with community members who are experiencing chronic and compound stress. The interior composition of a client serving environment can further induce toxic stress. This session will explore how the positioning of furniture in the workplace, color pallets, art, lighting, plants, sound and ergonomics can reduce stress for both provider and client. Participants will learn trauma informed design principles that promote wellness and biophilia in the workplace.Collaboration over CompetitionThursday, 9/21/23, 1-4 pmCapitalism is baked into institutions’ operating norms.  Disrupting Eurocentric ethos of rugged individualism, scarcity and competitiveness in the Black social uplift space is important to our collective movement and sustainability. Dismantling social determinants of health will require the disruption of silos that further reinforce competition over collective impact and outcomes.   To embrace the principles of Ubuntu (I am because we are) is to begin to unlearn the principles of bootstrapping.  Participants will learn how to incorporate the principles of Ubuntu, create and deepen partnerships and collaborations, and identify tools to interact with those who have not embraced the principles of Ubuntu.Dismantling the Myth of White Supremacy at WorkThursday, 10/19/23, 1-4 pmThe Myth of White Supremacy is centered in every aspect of workplace culture, interpersonally and structurally. It is not just the water in which we all exist; it is an anti-oppressive decision point that one ultimately decides to make or not to make. Dismantling the myth of white supremacy in work environments requires individuals, communities, and organizations to understand the stakes and range of possibilities of either choice. This session will explore the tactics used to promote the myth of white supremacy culture, including supervisory styles, communication practices, competitive environments, and performance reviews.  Participants will engage in experiential processes that uncover the operating norms, as well as, uncover strategies to dismantle operational practices, policies, and procedures that reinforce and burden internal and external stakeholders. Facilitating Data-Driven REDIThursday, 11/16/23, 1-3 pm With a standard in place that defines and identifies what it means to be diverse, equitable and inclusive it becomes possible to measure diversity, equity and inclusion in a company, understand that company’s “level” of diversity, equity and inclusion against the standard and drive measurable and methodical results - i.e. make the company more diverse, equitable and inclusive over time. This requires data skills on the part of the facilitator and leaders in the company. This session will introduce participants to a new measurement system and tool for diversity, equity and inclusion, and methods for understanding decision funnels in companies that can be analyzed and utilized to drive improvements.These sessions are in part sponsored by Innovation Works.",

We want this to be an event that strives to recreate the unique experience found at TED, where the world’s leading thinkers and doers congregate to share what they are most passionate about. At its core, the fundamental goal of TED and TEDxUStreetWomen is to foster and spread great ideas while celebrating Washington DC and the U Street Corridor community. 														  			Bold + Brilliant = Badass is our Mantra! What do we mean when we say, Bold + Brilliant =  Badass?  To be Bold, means you are willing to speak out for the issues that mean the most to you.  To be Brilliant, means you have the experience, knowledge, and passion needed to advocate for your idea. When you combine Bold + Brilliant, the results is a Badass. Being a Badass means that, despite your fear, any potential backlash/criticism, or how unpopular your idea maybe to some, you will still push forward to share your truth.   														  BE BOLD.   BE BRILLIANT.   BE BADASS.
  BE BETTER 
 We've all heard the saying - do better.  We've even challenged ourselves to do better.  This year's theme takes doing better to another level.  You will hear speakers share their ideas on how doing is not enough, we as humans need to BE Better.  To be better means to do things at a higher degree often and consistently to create sustainability. Join us as we look at ways to Be Better humans. Are you ready to be a part of a network and connect with individuals who are Bold, Brilliant and Badass?Why TEDxUStreetWomenWomen are realizing that the way things used to be is not the way things should be. More and more, women are becoming empowered to break the glass ceilings and strive towards finding their place in leadership roles. Roles that challenges the old way of thinking while creating opportunities for women to make a difference in the world. Women are not new to leadership; think of Cleopatra or Queen Elizabeth. Think of the women who led the civil rights and education reform movements. However, women are still outnumbered by men in the most prestigious positions, from Capitol Hill to the board room.Although a lot is being done to change the way women are seen, much still needs to be done. Women make up more than half the U.S. population, yet there are only one in five women in Congress. Men still out pace women in salaries and positions. Women across the globe are regaining their confidence and becoming bold, brilliant and unapologetic. During this conference, we will celebrate, not only the successes of women, but ponder on ways to be innovative and inspirational. Ways to affect the planet and the people on it.We want to change the social norms and empower women to be Bold and Brilliant.  We don't want women to be ashamed of speaking their truths.  This platform is for Badass women who want to share their idea that can change the world!Why U Street Corridor?As a 6th generation Washingtonian, I’ve always known U Street to be a community build on activism. Arthur Ashe once said, “The corner of 14th and U was the grapevine. . . . If you were at that corner, you always had the sense that something big was about to happen”.  Known as Washington’s cultural center at the turn of the century, U Street has long been a backbone of the city’s homegrown jazz, arts, and civil rights movements. Once bearing the scars of riots and protests, today it has regained its rightful place as the street to showcase DC’s vibrant cultural life, from music and food to activism and art. U Street has historically brought Washingtonians together to the sound of its homegrown music, from jazz and blues to rock and go-go. Today its renovated clubs, new restaurants and shops are once again the center of DC’s humming nightlife. U Street is home for those who want to march to their own beat.  It’s both historic and colorful, boasting some of the richest culture of the city and full of bars, restaurants, and boutiques – as well as plenty of DC locals who come to enjoy the culture and the people-watching.

You need to remember how to make time for yourself. And you've grown accustomed to being on auto-pilot as you tend to the needs of everyone around you.  You're looking for a process that will guide you into a sustainable journaling practice that celebrates you. You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals. ANYONE CAN WRITE SOMETHING DOWN ON PAPER, BUT BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE JOURNALING PRACTICE THAT'S FUN REQUIRES CONSISTENCY. Are you ready to explore what journaling that celebrates yourself could look and feel like for you? Sign up today, check your email for details, and arrive ready to go all in!

A brief review of cognitive theories sheds light on the reasons why inaccurate information persists. A discussion of current practices in public health and emergency management provides insight into why relational approaches built on dialogue and trust are effective in addressing misinformation.Keynote - Old Tricks, New Tools: Three Keys to Freedom from Division & Deception - Sabrina Joy Stevens (9:15-9:35 am)Information disorder - the toxic mix of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation bad actors use to pollute our collective thinking around important social, economic, and political matters — has become a hot topic in recent years, and for a good reason. Virtually all of us have fallen prey to its deceptive, divisive effects in some aspect of our lives and have felt its consequences in our relationships and other issues that affect our shared quality of life. So how can we protect ourselves, our communities, and our causes from the insidious effects of hate and deception? In this funny, practical talk, longtime civil rights activist and communications strategist Sabrina Joy Stevens exposes the age-old political manipulation tactics at the root of what social scientists now call information disorder. Relying on both personal experience and robust research, she breaks down how bad actors mislead the rest of us into hate and self-sabotage for their own political and economic gain. She also reveals how love, humility, and courage can help us outsmart this kind of manipulation. While the scale of this problem has certainly increased with the advent of new technologies, information disorder is actually a very old, very familiar problem.

Delve into climate and energy futures and gauge the influence of disruptive climate change events on potential evolutions in citizen energy choices. About the WorkshopHorizon Europe ECOSENS-project.eu has created a workshop transporting participants to the year 2050. Join the 2050 Citizens' Committee for Energy Advice and work with others to develop recommendations for the European Commission on achieving a more balanced energy mix. After reading a 2050 newspaper reporting the extreme weather and “how we got here”, specialist and non-specialist stakeholders will delve into narrative and ethical arguments, explore trade-offs, and critically examine societal pathways and obstacles to a resilient energy mix.  The 3-hour in-person workshop will be very interactive, engaging group discussions, cooperative deliberation, and collaborative tasks.B﻿ackgroundAccording to the IPCC, before 2035 the average temperature on Earth is projected to surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists have warned that the probability of climate extremes increases with every tenth of a degree of warming. Innovation and disruptive climate events will have increasingly significant impact on both daily life and energy sources, with new evolutions in economic, social, and environmental factors driving energy demand. By projecting ourselves now into 2050, can we perceive more clearly what societal responses should be?  Scenario tools provide a context for exploring a range of possible future outcomes. They create space to exchange ideas and insights on how policies are shaped or changed in the face of new information. Join a range of fellow citizens as well as social science and policy researchers to look into our future and experiment with taking decisions that few imagine today.  Funded by the European Union.

Through a combination of theory and hands-on exercises, we’ll examine the various paths that can be taken to a cleaner, smarter and more caring fashion future. Together with a stellar line up of speakers and workshop hosts, we will collectively investigate the overarching goal of sustainable and circular fashion design. The program includes topics and methodologies such as local regeneration, material understanding  and craft, and remake & upcycle skills. Join us at NOoF's sustainable fashion and textile LAB for two fun and exploratory days with a group of like-minded individuals who wish to commit to a better fashion future!PROGRAM OUTLINEDay one:  What is sustainable fashion? What is the difference between circular and regenerative? How can the Fibreshed approach make a blueprint for the future of fashion & getting in touch with natural materials: working with your hands for craft methodolgies. Day two:  Upcycling through bio-based screen printing, 'remake' a bucket hat, and a Trashtalk from community visionaries Trashclub. E﻿XPERTS & MENTORSEvey Kwong [futurprimitiv]Evey Kwong is a designer and researcher whose practice evolves in the theme of craft-based technology by connecting with the origin of material cultures, people and place.Her works have been exhibited at the Museum of European Cultures [DE], HOW&WOW BASK IT! [Dutch Design Week] and U-JOINTS: Knots & Knits [Fiskars Biennale, FI]. fueled by her desire to promote crafts making, she collaborates with various institutions on design research projects and workshops. For the Design for Change Retreat, Evey will lead the workshop ‘Connecting Twines’. The earliest twine was made by twisting, untwisting and braiding lengths of plant fiber. Twine is most commonly used in textiles and basketry. The invention of twine is at least as important as the development of stone tools for early humans. Archaeologists have called the development of twine, which can be made stronger and longer than its component fibers, “the string revolution”.Pollyanna MossPollyanna Moss engages in local practices of crafts and explores their inherent narratives. Her work materialises subjective and complex relationships between humans and the environment through design pieces and video installations, which together provide a careful reading of the landscapes she investigates. Through her design practice, Pollyanna develops strong working relationships with multiple parties - co-ordinating and communicating through shared care for the environment, and the species that inhabit various local domains. For the Design for Change Retreat, Pollyanna will be presenting her project 'Shed and Heddle', which explores a 15km production radius for local regenerative wool blankets, in a scalable format. Helen MilneHelen Milne is the LAB Manager at New Order of Fashion (NOoF) and deep dives into circular & regenerative design research and education. She writes and mentors NOoF residencies and leads the circular theory classes taught at the LAB for schools, university students and companies. She has a BA in Textile Design (Woven Specialism) from Central St. Martins  and an MA in Contextual Design from Design Academy Eindhoven. She's particularly interested in embodied craft knowledges, connecting diverse practitioners and developing practical examples of circular design methods. For the Design for Change Retreat, Helen will introdcue you to the overall landscape of Circular Design methodologies in Fashion, and be present throughout the week for discussions, organisation, and your main point of reference from NOoF! UNCOLOUR StudiosUNCOLOUR Studios is a textile innovations start-up that is developing the first entirely biodegradable and bio-based silk screen printing ink with natural colours from the food industry and agricultural waste, founded by Anabel Poh and Sarah Roseman.

UNCOLOUR Studios intends to push the frontiers of industrial printing in textiles by precisely developing a one-of-a-kind natural silkscreen binder. Hence, giving a viable commercially-scaleable alternative within the textile industry to replace plastisol- or acrylic-based screen printing inks.For the Design for Change Retreat, UNCOLOUR Studios invite you to learn how to upcycle your textiles, bags, clothes, and accessories using eco-friendly techniques. They will guide you through the entire process of silkscreen printing and help you to discover the beauty of natural colours. You will create your own vibrant, natural colour palette, and have the opportunity to experiment with printing different patterns, motifs, and designs, by creating your own temporary stencil patterns. Wolter PotRotterdam based designer Wolter Pot is the hottest face on the Dutch fashion scene, navigating the moment with his unconventional (yet sustainable) approach to fashion. Pot describes him selves as typical dutch, 'Simple shapes with a huge gesture'.For the Design for Change Retreat, Wolter  will guide participants through the process of turning old towels into treasures. We take towels as a base to create a bucket hat: a perfect and easy summer accessory!Fibreshed NederlandFibershed is a global movement of local communities developing regional fiber systems that build soil and protect the health of our biosphere.

Simply that our most important task is to get off our present collision course. And who is there to tackle such a task? I think every one of us, whether old or young, powerful or powerless, rich or poor, influential or un-influential.”- E.F. Schumacher. First Annual Small is Beautiful Lecture:The Next 50 yearsOn the 50th anniversary of E.F. Schumacher's seminal work Small is Beautiful, the core idea of his work — a placed-based economy in sync with living ecosystems and social needs — is as urgent and relevant as it has ever been. To honour Schumacher's ideas and move them forward in our time of ecological crisis and economic overreach, we feel the time is right for a Schumacher-inspired center in the Netherlands. 		“An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.”With an emphasis on the actionable, we envision a physical transformative space, a LAB, where a diversity of individuals, groups and organisations can explore, build and further the new ideas, social practices, technologies and policies for building a new type of society. The center will draw on the special contributions of arts and culture, economics, ecological sciences, and personal development.To help kick off a wider public consideration of Schumacher NL, we are proud to announce that commons activist and scholar David Bollier will deliver the first annual Small Is Beautiful Lecture at the Kleine Aarde in Boxtel on September 14, 2023.  David is Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the Schumacher Center for a New Economics in Massachusetts, United States. De Kleine Aarde, as a contemporary model, breathes Schumacher's work.  Hereby, we cordially invite you to be part of  our common movement.

The focus will be on “Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment”. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day. Programme9.00 – Registration & Coffee9.30 –  Keynote:  Ton van Vlimmeren (Netherlands) – Libraries Building Sustainable CommunitiesTon van Vlimmeren is the President of the European Library Organization (EBLIDA), member of the Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Libraries Section of IFLA and one of the founders of Public Libraries 2030. This keynote will highlight how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help libraries on their journey towards a sustainable, inclusive, and democratic society10.20 – Lightning Talks: STRATEGIES & CHALLENGES: IMPLEMENTING SDGS IN LIBRARIESMinna Männikkö (Finland) – Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap: Climate Action in Oulu, Finland In 2020, Oulu City Library implemented a Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap. Based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library’s daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) – Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) – Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 –  Coffee Break 11.30 – Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) – Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups – shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) – SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) – MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 – Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 –  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) – Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant.

We will free ourselves, connecting to our inner wisdom, our voice and the innate power of our hearts. As we allow the magic mushroom to rewire our neural pathways we receive a powerful spark of guidance, inspiration and clarity on our path.The pure magic of this sacred medicine brings forth deep transformation, healing and self-realization.Experiencing the magic mushroom as a beautiful doorway towards our essence and our heart's wisdom.We connect with others through presence. We expand together through plant medicine, sharings, meditation & visualisations, moments of silence, intense journeys and deep transformation.WHAT IS PSILOCYBIN ASSISTED THERAPY?Magic Mushrooms are the general name of mushrooms that contain psilocybin and psilocyn. Psilocybin is a psychoactive substance that acts on serotonin brain receptors resulting in changes of perception, cognition and emotion. It is a highly visionary natural compound with a long tradition of shamanic use and a close similarity to normal brain chemistry.The FDA granted psilocybin the “breakthrough therapy” status. Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic truffles and magic mushrooms, has been shown (in studies conducted by Johns Hopkins University, NYU, Imperial College) to be effective in treating depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms and OCD. 70% of participants who received psilocybin had a complete mystical experience. Two-thirds of the participants ranked the experience among the top five most meaningful of their entire lives (comparable to events such as childbirth or the death of a parent). One-third felt that the psilocybin trip was the single most spiritually significant experience they ever had. Psilocybin has also been shown to boost creativity and problem-solving skills.MORE ABOUT THE EVENT:Tapping into the personal and collective unconscious with the use of the magic mushrooms is an ancient tradition. Some historians believe that magic mushrooms may have been used as far back as 9000 B.C. in North African indigenous cultures. Evidence of mushrooms were also found in Mayan and Aztec ruins in Central America. The Aztecs used a substance called teonanácatl, which means ""flesh of the gods,"" that many believe was magic mushrooms. In the West, magic mushrooms began to be eaten in the late 1950s.IS IT LEGAL?The mushrooms that we use in our ceremonies are the magic truffles. They are non-toxic to the body and 100% legal in the Netherlands.The mission that I see for SHFT Happens is to mobilize key groups that have the capacity to empower more of the many:Companies: By working closely with organizations, I help design, communicate, and implement change programs that prioritize long-term sustainability, employee well-being, and positive societal impact.Mental Wellbeing Professionals: I support mental wellbeing professionals in upgrading their profession to meet the evolving needs of individuals and society. Through the integration of innovative approaches, evidence-based practices, and continuous professional development, we can better serve individuals in their personal growth, resilience, and transformative journeys.Individuals on a Personal Development Path: I firmly believe in the power of personal growth and self-transformation as catalysts for broader change. By empowering individuals to embark on their own growth journeys, I encourage them to become agents of positive change within their communities and spheres of influence, amplifying the impact of collective efforts.As we navigate this critical period of unprecedented change, I invite you to join me on a journey of transformation. Together, we can create a world that is sustainable, compassionate, and equipped to face the challenges of the future. The miracle we seek lies within our collective efforts to change ourselves.",

These fabrics present images and messages that are like archives of meanings that tell of an ambiguous relationship linked to the European colonial period. Fashion designers and creative directors Semhal Tsegaye Abebe, Bubu Ogisi, and Zinzi de Brouwer will also highlight initiatives and design projects that reveal the richness of African textile heritage still little known in Europe today, and their connection with sustainability. Some of the topics brought to the discussion will emerge from a participatory workshop that Caterina Pecchioli will lead previously at CBK Zuidoost Broedplaats Heesterveld and interviews collected on these issues by Caterina Pecchioli and Roxane Mbanga between Amsterdam and Paris.The Roundtable is organized within the framework of Decolonizing the Gaze - The Colonial Heritage of Italian and International Fashion Design and Its Impact on the Collective Imagination a project by Caterina Pecchioli which proposes a visual and historical analysis of dress items, fabrics, and accessories from the Italian and Dutch colonial period that are preserved in the collections of the Ex Museo Coloniale in Rome and Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam. A participatory study that aims to bring the Italian decolonial perspective within a live European debate on the decolonization of fashion and culture and on the political uses of fashion and clothing. The complex relationship between de-colonialism, heritage, cultural globalization, and “Made in Italy” is tackled through a program of workshops and seminars with the collaboration of institutions engaged on the subject in Italy, Holland, Ethiopia, South Africa, and the USA. In the Netherlands Caterina Pecchioli is an artist-in-resident at the Thami Mnyele Foundation for the months of June and July 2023 to develop the Dutch stage of the project.",

Indeed, healthy riparian ecosystems promote ecological and climate resilience both within and beyond riparian zones, lead to the accrual and sequestration of carbon and nitrogen in soil, absorb heat and buffer organisms against extreme temperatures. Cascade Ranch is within an area of high biological richness and surrounded by California protected areas. About 1.2 miles of Cascade Creek fall within the boundaries of the property, which is currently managed by the non-profit Pie Ranch. Cascade Creek represents an important habitat connectivity area for a wide array of plants and animals and a potential traditional food source for people. Unfortunately, the riparian zone has been highly affected by the spreading of invasive plant species, which are causing loss of biodiversity and related ecosystem services and products. The 2020 CZU complex fire has further contributed to the increase in number, variety and spread of invasive species along Cascade Creek.Your hard work and participation will help shape the future of this land!

Eydís Evensen,Ages 21+,"Tuesday, October 17, 2023, 8:00 PM","Tuesday, October 17, 2023, 10:00 PM","2174 Market St San Francisco, CA 94114",SF,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eydis-evensen-tickets-607844538377,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/noise-pop-presents-27658561079,"“Classical music gamechanger” The Line Of Best Fit“Few artists are so effortlessly able to twist your heartstrings into a contortion of joy, sorrow and despair like Eydís Evensen” Wonderland Magazine​Some time ago, Eydís Evensen wrote a poem. This poem became the basis of a two-part choir composition, describing “a beautiful light that froze,” before concluding with a glimmer of hard-fought hope. “ljósið fagra lifir enn ljósið fagra lifir enn,” echoing voices on the second part of that composition insist – translating in English to “the beautiful light still survives.” The words were a reminder, to herself and to the world, that no matter the darkness around you, there’ll come a point when the pain will begin to thaw, so it’s always worth holding on. “It represents there always being something beautiful at the end of even the most terrible experience,” the Blönduós-born model-turned-piano sensation insists, “no matter how terrible the ordeal.” These words ripple through every note and melody of her astonishing second album, titled – what else? – The Light. It’s a record inspired by the resilience in all of us, she says – our ability to stand firm in the face of personal and collective catastrophe.The 29-year-old – who also sings on the album, for the first time – confronted her own hardships and sorrows in order to create The Light. Some were born from the crises we all endured together: the Covid-19 pandemic; her horror at Russia’s war on Ukraine; her dread that the glaciers and natural wonders of her native Iceland that inspired her to write music in the first place will soon be devastated by the impact of climate change. There were also personal ordeals – ghosts from her past to be exorcised, demons in her closet that pushed her to challenging brinks. As the toll of these situations weighed on her, Evensen did what she always did: she sat at her piano, stretched her fingers and began to play. “It’s always been like that,” smiles the artist. “I remember [as a child] walking to the piano and being able to let something out by playing the keys. It became a therapist and a best friend to me – I always felt better after I played.”Throughout her early life, Evensen never strayed far from that best friend. She played it every day growing up in the 800-person town of Blönduós, whenever her parents weren’t playing Led Zeppelin and Tchaikovsky on the family record player that is. When the composer later fell into a career as an international model, travelling the world, she sought out a piano wherever she was (even once knocking on a door in London when she heard the sound of piano from an open window, so she could ask to play). In 2021, she released her debut album Bylur and immediately found herself touted as a vital new voice in contemporary classical music. Millions of streams on Spotify were followed by millions more on YouTube, where a KEXP live session went viral (one of the top comments on the video states: “this music makes you forget about time” – not an inaccurate assessment).When her equally well-received 2022 EP Frost further cemented her reputation as a glimmering new talent, Evensen should have been on top of the world. Instead, there were historic traumas still to be worked through. It was only after heading back home to Blönduós, and a subsequent breakthrough in her recovery from a devastating childhood ordeal, that the creative floodgates opened for her and The Light really began to take shape. “For two days, I composed and cried. I put my phone on record and just played whatever I could play,” she recalls. “In those recordings I moved through all of these emotions.”Emotion is ever-present on The Light, a record that shows not just Evensen’s personal growth but a musical expanding of wings, too. Opener Anna’s Theme is a competitive float that pulls you into a dream-like state, teetered tonally between heartache and hope. Choral composition The Light II underlines Evensen’s new-found boldness away from piano (not to mention her eventual aspirations to move into film scoring: “that’s definitely a dream of mine”). Finally, horns and strings entwine on the soaring Tephra Horizon before Full Circle begins to pull the album’s narrative back towards brightness – back towards that beautiful light that still survives. Perhaps most personal to the 29-year-old is the track Near Ending. “I composed that piece following my experience in Blönduós,” Evensen reveals. “I hadn’t played it since I composed it and I didn’t want to practise or demo it before recording it for the album. I wanted it to be completely raw. What’s on the album is the only take I did, in complete free-flow.”Why share all this? “I thought it’s important to be honest about these emotions so that maybe it can help people,” says the composer. “It’s been a really hard last couple of years for everyone. In that time, I’ve had a lot of messages about how my music has helped them with personal experiences, losing relatives and going through illnesses. Those messages have been such a gift.” The Light is Evensen’s gift in return – an astonishingly powerful call-to-arms to carry on, because after the darkness comes dawn. It always has, and it always will.",

Burnt by Clare Frank at Napa County Library,"Join us for an evening with author Clare Frank as she discusses her powerful memoir, Burnt.","September 5, 2023, 6:00 PM","September 5, 2023, 7:00 PM","580 Coombs St. Napa, CA 94559",SF,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/burnt-by-clare-frank-at-napa-county-library-tickets-669618556127,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/napa-bookmine-17833336597,"ABOUT THIS BOOK:When Clare Frank was 17 years old, she became a firefighter in Northern California. Clare was five foot two and too young to officially join the service—she left her birthdate blank on her paperwork, hoping no one would notice. And she didn’t look like her peers, who sported an Adam’s apple and a mustache. But her brother was a firefighter and loved it, so she thought she’d try it out, too. Very soon, she knew she’d found her calling.Burnt: A Memoir of Fighting Fire  is Clare’s inspiring, richly detailed, and open-hearted account of an extraordinary life in fire. It chronicles the transformation of a young adult determined to prove her mettle into a scarred and sensitive veteran, grappling with the weight of her duties as Chief of Fire Prevention—one of the highest-ranking women in Cal Fire history—while record-setting fires engulf her home state. Mentors and managing, funerals and scandal, pickup basketball, car crashes, and always fire—no one has written about this world, from this perspective, like Clare Frank. She masterfully mixes irreverence and awe, taking readers inside station houses, on daily calls, and along on wildfire campaigns where antics and dark humor balance terrifying risk, trauma, and a sense of almost holy responsibility. Burnt is an unforgettable memoir from an American original.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Clare Frank started firefighting in California at 17 and was promoted up the ranks, becoming the state’s first and only female Chief of Fire Protection. Along the way, she earned a BS in fire administration, an MFA in creative writing, and a JD. She has lectured at colleges, universities, and state and national fire conferences, and lives near Lake Tahoe with her husband and two dogs. This is her first book.PRAISE FOR BURNT:“A vigorous and quite timely memoir . . . Throughout the book, Frank is energetic and inspirational, especially to women considering work in the field.” —Kirkus Reviews“Good memoirs can introduce intriguing individuals and provide access to rarefied pursuits. Author Frank manages both. . . The action scenes are compelling; there are hardwon victories and excruciating losses, and Frank emerges as a relatable and thoroughly human hero.”			   —Booklist“In this evocative account of life in the firehouse, Clare Frank portrays the risks firefighters face and the stakes that are now higher than they’ve ever been. She does so with grit and a healthy sense of humor. A must-read.” —Erin Brockovich“Ominous orange skies and smoke-choked cities: The wildfire crisis is here. Burnt takes you inside. From dirt firefighter to leading thousands, Clare Frank offers a real, humorous, one-of-a-kind front-row seat to wildfires and those who fight them.” —Caroline Godkin, Executive Director of the Climate and Wildfire Institute",

From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

In the early '80s, Mould emerged as one of the founding members of Hüsker Dü, a Minneapolis-based punk band who blended furiously fast tempos with melodic pop structures on influential, groundbreaking albums like 1984's Zen Arcade and 1985's New Day Rising. After the breakup of Hüsker Dü, Mould launched a solo career with 1989's introspective, largely acoustic Workbook, but soon returned to a hard, angry sound on 1990's Black Sheets of Rain. In 1992, Mould formed another band, Sugar, who picked up where the pop-oriented sound of Hüsker Dü left off on albums like 1992's Copper Blue and 1994's File Under: Easy Listening. After Sugar split up in 1995, Mould returned to solo work, dividing his time between guitar-oriented efforts like 1998's The Last Dog and Pony Show and projects like 2002's Modulate that reflected his growing interest in electronic music. Mould walked a middle ground between the two styles on 2008's District Line, but with 2012's Silver Age, he recommitted himself to fluid but aggressive rock. It was the first in a series of albums that reaffirmed his status as one of indie rock's strongest talents, and 2019's Sunshine Rock and 2020's Blue Hearts were celebrated as some of the best music of his life.At present Smith writes, performs, lending support for human-rights issues and environmental groups, primarily Pathway to Paris, a nonprofit organization co-founded by her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith, offering tangible solutions for combatting global climate.

WINECLASS: Native Grapes,Explore a whole world of exciting native grapes beyond the usual suspects in this fun journey through ancient Italy.,"July 30, 2023, 4:00 PM","July 30, 2023, 6:00 PM","Prima Materia Winery Tasting Room, 49th Street Oakland, CA 94609",SF,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wineclass-native-grapes-tickets-667806125097,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/paul-robinson-59028133663,"Italy is home to more native grape cultivars than any other winemaking country in the world, incuding France. When the Phoenicians arrived before the Romans in 7th Century BC, they coined the term 'Enotria' or 'land of the vine' for its incredible diversity from region to region, often growing in such abundance traveller would pick and eat along the road! Today, the average consumer is inundated with a huge range of Italian wines, often resulkting in a dizzying 
experience at the shop or restaurant.In this tasting, sommelier Paul Robinson will introduce participants to 7 rising stars in the vast world of Italian grapes today. Cagnulari from Sardegna, Magliocco from Calabria and Nascetta from Piemonte are just a few we will be tasting and discussing in this class. Paul will cover each grapes history, characteristics and local food pairings. SERIES DESCRIPTION: 'Through the Glass' are one-of-a-kind wine experiences where history, cuisine and the culture of winemaking are presented together to provide an immersive educational experience. In contrast with classes found at culinary schools, restaurants and wineries, this program reflects a single sommelier working experience with Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and American wines. With maps, informational booklets and a curated selection of wines to light the way, Paul leads participants deep into the chosen subject, providing not only wine education but a snapshot of a place and its people.FINE PRINT:- All attendees must be at least 21 years of age.- All sales are final- Participants will receive 1.5 ounce pours from each bottle- The duration of the tasting will be 90-120minHOW TO BOOK1. Follow link to Eventbrite page.  2. Select class, number of tickets and purchase.  3. Recieve welcome email from me, including all details.  4. Receive final confirmation email 24hrs prior to classWHAT TO EXPECT: Tastings begin with a brief rapid-fire presentation on history, geography, climate and soil. Once the stage has been set, I then lead a round-table discussion which includes a sensory evaluation of each wine and information on good service, suggested food pairings and much more. Tastings run between 90-120 minutes in length. Participants will receive a collateral booklet to follow along and make notes. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Classes are designed for all levels of wine experience/education, from newbies to aficionados. There are no ""amateur questions"" and I vigorously protect the opinions of all my attendees. THE VENUE: The Prima Materia tasting room is located at 482 #B, 49th St, Oakland, CA 94609. The venue holds a maximum of 12 participants, seated comfortably on high stools with cushions provided. At the apex of the space will be my perch, surrounded by maps and anything I need to deliver a great wine experience. The room has been outfitted with a modern overhead vent, which provides a steady current of air. Windows along the street-side of the space will remain open for ventilation. Participants are encouraged to wear a comfortable sweater or jacket to combat the draft, until the weather breaks and I can move the tastings outside. That’s right, there is a beautiful outside area I absolutely cannot wait to expand into once the weather turns! THE WINES: Classes will typically feature 7 wines poured in 2-3 flights. Participants will receive a 1.5-2oz pour from each bottle, with a little left over for revisiting. Over the years, I learned the success of a class begins with an above-average selection of wines reflecting the best possible expressions from a given area. This not only includes benchmark wineries, but also smaller producers who are doing amazing things in the vineyard and winery. ABOUT YOUR SOMMELIER: Paul Robinson has been in the hospitality business for over 15 years. His career began in the private event business in NYC, where he led large-scale galas and dinners for Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. After a meaningful trip to Italy, he pursued certification as a sommelier in CA before moving into restaurants full-time. First, for a brief stint in Yountville, then to SF, where he led an extensive wine and cheese program at Chiaroscuro Ristorante. After several years, Paul moved back to NYC to be near family. He poured wine at Del Posto, further deepening his knowledge and appreciation of Italian wines. After departing Del Posto, Paul found a local retail shop/school which would plant the seed for a future business: curating educational deep dives into important regions and appellations all over the wine world. CA beckoned him to return and he has spent the last 3 years running a new business BOTTIVINO.Paul is a certified sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers and a member of the ruling council of the Cavalieri del Tartufo e Dei Vini di Alba - SF Bay Area chapter.

Well, the answer is an emphatic and resounding YES! In this tasting, it is my absolute pleasure to introduce 7 wines that will forever change your views of Italian whites.

That’s Manny’s.We offer our events space to nonprofits, activists, and civic organizations to do their work as well as host our own civic and arts-related programming.We are committed to the community, aspire to be useful, and welcome every single person into our doors with heart.

Chuy’s family grew their food in the backyard and always had a pot of something mouthwatering simmering on the stove. After graduating from the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco in 2005, he moved to Chicago to work at Frontera Grill under famed Chef Rick Bayless. He then served as Chef de Cuisine for Adobo Grill for their two locations in Chicago. In late 2009 he opened Chilam Balam in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago to local and national acclaim.  This lead to appearances on Bravo TV's Top Chef Season 9 as well as on Food TV’s Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. In 2013 Chuy moved back to Sonoma County and began to focus on food and wine pairing by working with local private chefs and caterers. This led to a four year stint as a Chef d’ Partie for Silver Oak Cellars where he collaborated with the Executive Winery Chef, creating and leading the food and wine pairing experience. We’re so excited to welcome Chuy to our roster of GP Dinner chefs and look forward to many gorgeous meals together.OUR MENU: TO START: Ahi Tuna Ceviche Tostada w/Avocado and Strawberry (GF)Crispy Maitake Mushrooms w/Pasilla Chile Drizzle (VE GF) Blue Corn Masa Empanada w/Toma Cheese, Molcajete Salsa (GF VG) MAINS: Grilled Brentwood Corn, Lime, Chile Quebrado, Cotija and Tat Soi (GF VG)Charred Baby Heirloom Squash w/Pumpkin Seed Mole (VE GF)Rancho Gordo Beans w/Quelites and Roasted Garlic (VE GF)Roasted Eggplant “Barbacoa” w/Tomatillo Salsa Verde (VE GF)Duroc Pork Spare Ribs Al Pastor w/Pineapple Pico de Gallo (GF DF)Banana Leaf Roasted Local Rock Cod w/Achiote and Pickled Manzanos (GF DF) TO FINISH: Tres Leches Cake, Hibiscus Macerated Summer Berries and Almond Praline (VG)Please email us at least 72 hours in advance if you have any dietary restrictions and we'll do our best to accommodate them.Drinks at 6:00, dinner at 7:00.

SIT. LISTEN. SEE. FEEL. SMELL. BREATHE.

The practice focuses on the idea that spending time simply breathing in the natural world is beneficial and healing.Walk Leader Roz Greenfield: Roz is a successful entrepreneur and tech executive. To counteract the high velocity and stress of the tech world, she has turned to nature as a way to bring better balance into her life. As her relationship with nature deepened, she found the practice of Forest Bathing has enhanced her experience and made time spent in nature more meaningful. She is deeply concerned about the human impact on our climate and believes that the practice of Forest Bathing deepens our connection to nature, leading to an increased awareness and more respectful relationship with nature. As a Certified Forest Bathing guide, she partners with the forest to provide a doorway and framework for humans to be in reciprocity with nature. Within this space of balanced offering and receiving, she provides a way for people to not only reconnect with nature but to take better care of our environment as a result. Roz holds a Forest Bathing certification from ANFT and a Wilderness First Aid certification from Survival Med.What to expect: ~ A leisurely walk of less than a mile.

Underbelly: The Art of Slowing Down,Underbelly is a non-verbal somatic practice (freeform movement meditation) where we reclaim our slow in a fast and overwhelming world.,"July 10, 2023, 7:00 PM","July 10, 2023, 10:00 PM","The Berkeley Alembic, 2820 Seventh Street Berkeley, CA 94710",SF,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/underbelly-the-art-of-slowing-down-tickets-665456928587,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-berkeley-alembic-foundation-44559759063,"Underbelly is a non-verbal somatic practice (freeform movement meditation) where we reclaim our slow in a fast and overwhelming world.  Our dominant culture survives on speed, which keeps problematic and oppressive structures in place at the devastating cost of our well-being and planetary health. Underbelly is a somatic response to the loss of slowness in an increasingly urgent world drowning in climate collapse, AI threat, technological addiction, diseased capitalism and polarization, as well as historical nervous system trauma from continuing racism, colonialism, and patriarchy. It’s time to dismantle the hurry and be in conversation with the present moment.This practice helps us explore the art of slowing down with ourselves, each other, and our current environment. There is space to metabolize our emotions, strengthen empathy and intuition, and develop an intimate relationship with our bodies and nature. We practice being in the questions themselves- listening and yielding to the intelligence of life without pushing, controlling, or fixing. Our individuation and togetherness are felt in a group field—deepening our presence and attunement with one another, co-regulating our nervous systems, being witnessed, held, considered, and noticed exactly as we are. We meet ourselves AS IS, without reaching for more or escaping/transcending reality.  We re-learn what it is to be relational instead of transactional.  To commune instead of consume. To be of service instead of self-serving. To rest back into the vastness and wildness of the natural world, releasing the tight circuits of programming, conditioning, and linearity we've known for so long.  Spend quality time with your body, breath, and being. Voyage beneath the surface of our fast culture, and dive into a slow sanctuary for unearthing what is alive, tender, and honest for you in every moment.​ This experience is not a solution, method, workshop or teaching of tools. It is not a business, ceremony, ecstatic dance, or dance class. It is a somatic gathering space that supports nervous system co-regulation, ample rest, and radical self/community care. About the Creator:Amy Rogg (she/her) is an activator and nurturer of the human spirit. She is half Taiwanese/half Jewish, born in Denver Colorado and raised mostly in the Bay Area. She is the conduit, creator, and facilitator of Underbelly: The Art of Slowing Down. Amy has a B.A. in television/film production and studied acting/improv in Los Angeles.

Barbara Lee is perhaps best known for being the only member of Congress to vote against war authorization after the Sept. 11 attacks, a decision that led to death threats and hate mail. But her willingness to take tough, progressive stands has endeared her to East Bay voters—who have re-elected her 13 times—and liberal Democrats across the country.Now, Lee is running to fill retiring California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat. “We have to ease the burden on the middle class. We have to find a solution to poverty and homelessness. We have to take on the climate crisis. And we have to stop these MAGA extremists who think they can control people’s bodies and dismantle our democracy,” she said when announcing her candidacy. If she succeeds, Lee would be the sole Black female senator and only the third in U.S. history.Lee returns to The Commonwealth Club as part of our “Race to the Senate 2024” series of candidate forums.

Lithium mines around the world are opening or expanding, while children as young as six in the Congo carry sacks of cobalt-laced rocks on their backs for less than $2 a day. Recycling presents promising opportunities, yet before millions of batteries can be recycled, they have to be made in the first place. At the same time, advances in battery chemistry continue to be made, and it’s not hard to imagine a near future when batteries don’t require lithium or cobalt at all. What’s the state of battery technology? And with demand ceaselessly increasing, how can we ever get to a truly sustainable supply chain?JB Straubel co-founded Tesla Motors and spent fifteen years as its Chief Technology Officer. Now, he heads Redwood Materials, a company dedicated to creating a circular battery supply chain in the U.S.The speakers and audience will be videotaped for future broadcast on the Climate One TV show on KRCB TV 22.

This area was referred to as ""over the tracks"" by the residents of Parchester Village, one of the few communities where minorities were allowed to purchase homes after World War II. The new residents were promised the marsh would always be open for recreation, nature appreciation, and views of the water. Beginning in the 1970's, it appeared that promise would be broken, as developers schemed to drain the marsh and develop the wetlands. Parchester resident Reverend Richard Dotson and his son, Whitney, led the community in a campaign to preserve the wetlands, stating ""everyone neglects the needs of low income communities to access to quality of life.""Ultimately,  the wetland area was acquired by the East Bay Regional Park District and the marsh renamed  in honor of the Dotson family. The Park District  has worked to restore the wetlands ecosystem and  protect Parchester Village from rising sea level and other dangers of climate change.O﻿ur adventure also includes hiking the beautiful Bay View and Woods trails, where we'll explore the serene natural  and explosive cultural history of the park area, host to numerous dynamite factories beginning in the 1880's through mid 20th century.N﻿orth Richmond is a Greenbelt Alliance Resilience Hotspot. The Bay Area Resilience Hotspots initiative is a blueprint for where we must protect communities that stand to lose the most in the face of climate change in ways that co-benefit habitats, open spaces, biodiversity, recreation, and more.

Home to the majestic Peace River, this region has been ravaged by more than 25,000 fracking wells threatening livelihoods, physical and mental health, and the very water that sustains the life and spirit of these communities. Fracking in B.C. is currently responsible for the majority of B.C.’s methane emissions. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is 86x more toxic for the atmosphere than CO2, and has been historically under-reported in B.C. Yet the fracking industry receives the single largest oil and gas subsidy from the B.C. government. Fracking the Peace paints a picture of how fracking development in B.C. has been allowed to skyrocket at the expense of the health and safety of watersheds, communities, and the rich agricultural landscape they call home.Fracking the Peace was created by Desiree Wallace in partnership with Stand.earthAre you unable to make the in-person event, or want to spread the word to friends and family outside of Victoria?

There are approximately 164 glaciers left, and many will cease to exist in our lifetime. While we may not be able to spare glacial ice from the ravages of climate change, we can preserve what the Olympic glaciers mean to us.

The goal is to provide a visual timeline of each glacier's life and story and draw attention to the impacts of climate change on the park's ecosystems.To learn more, visit: Terminus Glacier Memorial project, where you can see the Terminus Art that has already been created with new works of art added weekly.

Since the Iliad--in which we are shown golden statues built by Hephaestus ""with minds and wisdoms""--humans have been fascinated by the idea of artificial life. From the Argonautica to the medieval Jewish legend of the Golem and Ambrose Bierce's tale of a chess-playing robot, the idea of what robots are--and who creates them--can be drastically different.This book collects a broad selection of short stories from celebrated authors such as Philip K. Dick, Seanan McGuire, Roger Zelazny, Connie Willis, and many more. Robots through the Ages not only celebrates the history of robots and the genre of science fiction, but the dauntless nature of human ingenuity.This event is free to attend, though registration is required through the link provided.

Registration is required in advance.About Set Adrift. . .In January, 1958, a renowned sailing family was lost in a storm in the Bermuda Triangle. The youngest of two daughters, Sarah, suddenly an orphan, grew up never knowing her parents and grandparents. As an adult, she began to pursue the mystery of her family and their disappearance, and discovered that their stories were far different from the versions she was told. Sarah Conover’s memoir follows the national media’s investigation of the Revonoc’s vanishing, and exposes the truths that led her to “unstory” the family history, creating a new understanding of their lives, and hers.About Interrogating Travel. . .Never in human history has travel been so accessible to so many. But—amid an escalating climate crisis that threatens the homes of vulnerable people across the world—has the human cost of trekking the globe become too high? Paul Lindholdt links firsthand narratives with research about the travel trade, telling stories of his reluctant voyages while arguing that carbon-intensive trips abroad may be offset if adventurers come to know and love the landscapes closer to home. Tourism may be the planet’s largest industry, but Interrogating Travel advises readers to stay mindful of the consequences of their journeys, whether visiting local getaways or some of Earth’s most remote locations.Sarah Conover holds a BA in religious studies from the University of Colorado and an MFA in Creative Writing from Eastern Washington University. Her poetry, essays and interviews have been published in a variety of literary journals and anthologies including The Sun Magazine, and she is a feature writer and columnist for Tricycle Magazine: The Buddhist Review. She is an award-winning author of six books on world wisdom traditions and spirituality. A recipient of a Washington GAP Grant (Grants for Artists’ Projects), she has also received fellowships from the Ucross Foundation and the Willapa Bay Artist in Residence program. Her memoir, Set Adrift: My Family’s Disappearance in the Bermuda Triangle, a Mystery and a Memoir, will be released in June by 55 Fathoms Press. The History Channel, with a team of scientists and divers, is creating an episode of their Into the Bermuda Triangle series exploring the Conover family tragedy and aiming to find her family’s sunken yacht.Paul Lindholdt, Professor of English and Philosophy at Eastern Washington University, teaches literature and environmental humanities. Coming of age in Seattle and on Vashon Island, he studied in Bellingham at Fairhaven College under Annie Dillard and is working on a biography of her.

I can’t stop thinking about this visionary novel and its singular characters. Nick Fuller Googins has written a book for the present and the future — read this and you will be changed.” — Michelle Min Sterling, New York Times bestselling author of Camp Zero“A magnificent debut novel that’s both an important cautionary tale and a deeply compelling family story. Although set in a stunningly well-imagined future in the aftermath of a climate apocalypse, The Great Transition is electrifyingly relevant.” — William Kent Krueger, New York Times bestselling author of This Tender Land“[The Great Transition] melds the huge and the intimate, the imperatives of our global climate crisis with the more compact narrative of a family trying to do right by one another when the world goes sideways. Fuller-Googins stares down some of today's biggest societal issues with abundant imagination and endless empathy.” — Emily Nemens, author of The Cactus League“Nick Fuller Googins demonstrates exactly the kind of clear-eyed utopian thinking we’ll need more of as we work together to solve our climate crisis, wrapping a call to action, accountability, and mutual aid in a story that’s as thrilling as it is moving. Every worthwhile novel sets out to change its reader—this one sets out to change the world. I hope it does.” — Matt Bell, author of Appleseed“The Great Transition asks what it means to start over — as a society and as individuals — and then answers with visionary scope.

But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow.

It is a kind of absolute present, real life captured in closeup.“  —Annie Ernaux, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature About The Light Room:From “one of our most formally ambitious writers” (Esquire), a moving account of caretaking in a time of uncertainty and lossIn The Light Room, Zambreno offers her most profound and affecting work yet: a candid chronicle of life as a mother of two young daughters in a moment of profound uncertainty about public health, climate change, and the future we can expect for our children. Moving through the seasons, returning often to parks and green spaces, Zambreno captures the isolation and exhaustion of being home with a baby and a small child, but also small and transcendent moments of beauty and joy. Inspired by writers and artists ranging from Natalia Ginzburg to Joseph Cornell, Yūko Tsushima to Bernadette Mayer, Etel Adnan to David Wojnarowicz, The Light Room represents an impassioned appreciation of community and the commons, and an ecstatic engagement with the living world.How will our memories, and our children’s, be affected by this time of profound disconnection? What does it mean to bring new life, and new work, into this moment of precarity and crisis? In The Light Room, Kate Zambreno offers a vision of how to live in ways that move away from disenchantment, and toward light and possibility.About the author:Kate Zambreno is the author of many acclaimed books including Drifts, To Write As If Already Dead, and Heroines. Her writing has appeared in The New Yorker, Granta, The Paris Review, The White Review, and elsewhere. The recipient of a 2021 Guggenheim Fellowship in nonfiction, she teaches in the graduate nonfiction program at Columbia University and is the Strachan Donnelley Chair in Environmental Writing at Sarah Lawrence College.",

It's the story of one enormous tuna and the dedicated fisherman who first tagged her. Dubbed Amelia (for her transatlantic journey), this fish was first caught off the New England coast by an enigmatic man named Al Anderson. Though a lifelong professional fisherman, Anderson did not see fish simply as a means to a paycheck. Rather, he understood that his own livelihood depended on that of the fish he caught. In riveting detail, Pinchin follows the story of how Al's obsession - he tagged over 60,000 fish in his lifetime -  made him just as many enemies as it did friends, as he existed in the unique and often tense space between a booming bluefin tuna industry and science-fueled conservation efforts. Kings of Their Own Ocean is an urgent investigation that combines science, business, and social justice. Through this lens, readers will come to understand the horrible effects that climate change and over-fishing are having on our oceans. If we don’t understand how tuna live, breed, and move around, especially in this era of increasing climate change, then we run the risk of watching them vanish like Atlantic cod and wild Atlantic Salmon. As Pinchin writes, “Now is the moment when we will get to choose whether we want to live in a world with tuna — or not.”Karen Pinchin is an award-winning investigative journalist and culinary school graduate. A recent Tow Fellow at PBS's Frontline, she graduated from Columbia Journalism School with a Master of Arts in science journalism and has since been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Sloan Foundation. Her work has appeared in Scientific American, Canadian Geographic, Hakai Magazine, The Globe and Mail, and The Walrus, among other outlets. She lives, writes, and fishes in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with her husband, son, and a tankful of guppies.Photo credit: Matt HorsemanSabrina Imbler is the author of the essay collection, How Far the Light Reaches and the chapbook Dyke (geology), which was chosen for the National Book Award's Science + Literature program.

These problems are compounded by climate change, which causes issues such as reduced habitable space and deepened inequality. However, city planners can build resilience into their communities by leveraging new management techniques and smart technologies to improve livability.

Small and medium-sized cities account for more than half of the global urban population, and they continue to exhibit significant growth. To accommodate everyone, city authorities must prioritize sustainable development with a focus on inclusivity, safety, affordability, and resilience. They must also integrate infrastructure investments and policy reforms into their plans. Fortunately, new digital technologies aid decision-making and enable transparent, people-centered, and accountable governance in smart cities. However, the financing gap remains significant in developing countries. Thus, authorities should leverage resources and create economic opportunities to narrow the gap.

In response to SDG7, SDG9, SDG11, and SDG17, this side event shares best practices on smart and sustainable policy reform, digital development, climate resilience, modern waste management and health system design, and financing strategies. Audience members will learn more about key factors that enhance livability and resilience for all citizens, as well as how city authorities, companies, and community partners can build smarter and more sustainable cities together.

Through each character’s story, the film uncovers the often-overlooked potential of this 200-year-old machine, exploring its impact on a wide-range of global issues such as physical and mental health, socio-economic inequality and climate change.By shining a light on people who have embraced cycling as a way to overcome daunting personal and systemic challenges, The Engine Inside ultimately asks viewers to reconsider their own perspective. Is there a transformative power within us all that can be unlocked through the simple act of riding a bike?Narrated by the “voice of cycling” Phil Liggett, paired with an eclectic soundtrack and immersive cinematography, the film weaves together an emotional and informative celebration of the bicycle’s world-changing potential.

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.”


At this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.


This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.  Abundant hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be served.

As global leaders gather in New York for the UN Climate Ambition Summit and General Assembly, we are calling on governments to reckon with their role in fueling climate chaos, and harm against frontline communities and the planet  by continuing the extraction of fossil fuels . We only have a limited amount of years left to address and mitigate the worst impacts of the  climate crisis.

For years, global climate movements have been calling for governments to phase out fossil fuels and stop expansion. We continue to pressure governments, corporations, and financial institutions to adhere to the demands of  science and communities, and implement an immediate equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. Instead, governments must invest in and deploy a Just Transition that is grounded in a climate justice framework and uplifts care economies, community-led solutions, Indigenous rights,  and a different vision than business as usual.

During this event,  we will host two panels, please see below for descriptions.

“Women Ending the Era of Fossil Fuels”
During this panel discussion, global women leaders will share expertise and frameworks for transitioning away from extraction and  share ongoing policy advocacy and campaigns that seek to phase out fossil fuels, deforestation, and other harmful extractive practices. 

“Women-led Climate Solutions Are Central to a Just Transition and Thriving  Future”
In the second panel we will hear from  global women leaders and policy experts on how to implement and support  solutions that are advancing  a Just Transition. Speakers will share demonstrated successes of women’s leadership in reducing emissions, stopping fossil fuel extraction and deforestation, and implementing just community-led climate solutions.

Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.",

This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.

Our team represents a diverse range of backgrounds and viewpoints, ensuring a pluralistic outlook to identifying policy change.  As part of the youth network at the Faith & Belief Forum we work towards a more connected and supportive society where people of different faiths, beliefs and cultures have strong, productive, and lasting relations. We represent over 700 people who have graduated from the UN award-winning ParliaMentors programme and the wider body of young leaders who have engaged with our work over the years. Our research and surrounding campaign seek to highlight that increasing numbers of people will be forced from their homes due to climate change, needing refuge, and that UK policy is currently unfit to deal with its obligation to rehome them. We would therefore like to begin a dialogue and conversation on the topic of climate-based migration and the need for better policies on social integration of all migrants and displaced communities.During this event we will share the findings of our research, case studies and community campaign before opening a discussion about how to address the issues outlined.  We are interested in hearing from a wide range of voices. We want to begin dialogue with changemakers and people and organisations willing to engage with us on this issue.

There is a clear need for more clarity and certainty about what needs to be done to tackle climate change and decarbonise our lives. Our Net Zero Myth Busting report  is designed to dispel some of the popular myths and debunk some of the inaccuracies and, sometimes, outright misinformation about Net Zero transition.   Our Net Zero APPG 10 Point Action Plan and Net Zero Roadmap emphasised the importance of good communications and accurate information about Net Zero if we are to incentivise consumers and accelerate the behaviour change needed to get to Net Zero by 2050 - or sooner.We are delighted that we have gathered together so many informed contributions from MPs, business, academia and organisations who have written brilliantly to help us de-bunk myths.  We believe that our Net Zero Myth Busting Report will do much to influence future Government communications, inform future debate and help to change the narrative.",

The panels feature guest speakers presenting a project or provocation, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. Join us for these thought-provoking sessions and meet and share with others involved in the retrofit puzzle. In this panel, our Retrofit 23 principal partner; Arup, along with their invited speakers, will discuss how individual action can reduce the impacts and risks of urban heat in homes and other community buildings, as well as the bigger opportunities from collective action and wider programs of change. This event will be hosted by Becci Taylor, Director at Arup who is leading the company’s Retrofit at Scale business. The panel will also be chaired by Polly Turton, an Associate at Arup who is an experienced Environment and Public Health Consultant .The speakers for the event will include: Antonietta Canta, Senior Engineer, Arup  Sue Roaf, Professor Emeritus of Architectural Engineering, Heriot Watt UniversitySachin Bhoite, Director of Climate Resilience, C40 Annette Figueiredo, Principal Policy and Programme Officer, Greater London Authority Andy Love, Founder/Director, Love Design Studio and Shade the UK The challenge of retrofitting our buildings in energy efficient, low carbon and comfortable ways is exacerbated by climate change impacts and risks. In particular, overheating impacts and associated risks for mortality, health and productivity. The greatest impacts are often felt by the most vulnerable people, in the most exposed buildings and places. In London the challenge is even greater due to the additional effect of the urban heat island. Our panel speakers will explore how action to reduce urban heat risk can be taken alongside other drivers for retrofit such as decarbonisation and health equality, simultaneously improving people’s lives and contributing to green and thriving neighbourhoods.",

Climate cafés are not drop-in events, and numbers are limited to 12, so please try to arrive in time for the start (though we won’t turn you away if you’re a few minutes late and there are still spaces!).

Climate Cafés offer something different from the usual gatherings of people with interests in climate change. They are facilitated – so you can be sure that there will be space for you to speak. They are not designed to recruit you to do anything or to put you under any pressure. The idea behind them is that talking about climate change is really important – but it is often made more difficult by our feelings of guilt that we are not doing enough, or frustration that others are not doing enough. So a space is provided in which we don’t talk about what we or others are doing or should be doing. We just talk about climate change and how it is making us think and feel.

Everyone is welcome, though we don’t advise young children attending. (18 years plus) There’s no charge. We are hoping to run this as a regular session – so please support this event if you are interested.",

Energy security and net zero are two sides of the same coin. The energy transition and net zero are among the greatest opportunities facing this country and we are committed to ensuring that the UK takes advantage of its early mover status. Global action to mitigate climate change is essential to long term prosperity – the overall costs and risks of global warming to be equivalent to losing between 5% and 20% of global GDP each year.After decades of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s mission is to replace them with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy. In response to high household energy bills resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the government stepped in, paying around half of the average household’s energy bills over winter and around half of wholesale energy costs for some businesses. But the way to maintain lower cost energy for everyone is to move to cleaner and cheaper energy to protect us from volatile international energy markets, while underpinning our clean energy transition, so the UK becomes a net zero economy by 2050. It will also help us make sure Britain has among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe by 2035. The UK has already made huge progress in decarbonising its economy and decoupling emissions from economic growth. Thanks to the Climate Change Act (2008) and Environment Act (2021), we have a strong legal framework for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Between 1990 and 2021, we have cut our emissions by 48%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, whilst growing the economy by 65%. The UK was also the first G7 country to sign net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 into law. The UK’s strategy for net-zero is to lead the world in ending our contribution to climate change while turning this mission into the greatest opportunity for jobs and prosperity for our country since the industrial revolution.Removing dirty fossil fuels from the global economy will lead to the creation of vast new global industries from offshore wind to electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. By moving first and making the United Kingdom the birthplace of the Green Industrial Revolution we are building a defining competitive edge. The changes will have wider benefits for the public and businesses alike. We will all enjoy cleaner air, increased biodiversity and improved access to green spaces. We will see greater efficiency in the way we travel and heat our buildings, which will be better protected from more extreme weather events. We will also put consumers at the heart of this transition, helping them make their homes warmer, and more efficient, and ensure that they pay a fair, affordable price for their energy.In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero-emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. And everywhere you look, in every part of our United Kingdom, there will be jobs. Good jobs, green jobs, well-paid jobs, levelling up our country while squashing down our carbon emissions. That is the clean and prosperous future that awaits every one of us as the UK leads the world in the race to net zero. But we cannot tackle climate change alone. We will need to take a coordinated approach, working across local and national government, the devolved administrations, and with businesses and civil society organisations. And we will need to make it easier and fairer for individuals, businesses and households to decarbonise so that our whole society can work together to reduce emissions. Don’t miss this fantastic opportunity to attend the conference and hear from those leading on the net-zero agenda by highlighting key examples of case studies and projects from around the world using new innovations and technologies which can help accelerate the transition to a net-zero nation by 2050.Join us on the 15th of Novembner 2023 for the Net Zero Nations Projects Conference.Get Involved, We All Have A Part to Play…..Find Yours!",

Our aim is to give local transport, climate and countryside and nature campaigners an opportunity to share ideas and inspiration. We want to celebrate our successes and work out what we need to focus on over the next 12 months or so before a General Election and in the face of some extraordinary backlashes to taking action on health and climate grounds.A﻿lso, this year marks some notable anniversaries, it being the 30th anniversary of the first ever national anti-roads conference and major protests at Twyford Down, while it is the 60th anniversary of the infamous Beeching report. To mark the occasion Emma Must, a prominent campaigner from the 1990s and ALARM UK days has agreed to read some of her poetry about the anti-roads movement.W﻿e've got some great speakers and contributors:Jonathan Bray - ex-director, Urban Transport GroupRoxanne de Beaux - Executive Director, Camcycle (part of Cambridge Sustainable Travel Alliance)Isabelle Clement MBE - CEO, Wheels for WellbeingC﻿laire Haigh - founder & CEO of Greener VisionRoger Harrabin - former BBC environment correspondentLisa Hopkinson - associate of Transport for Quality of LifeProfessor Glenn Lyons - Professor of Future Mobility, UWE BristolDavid Milner - Deputy Director, Create StreetsStefan Rollnick - Head of The Misinformation Cell, Lynn GlobalWe've gone for London to make it easier for those from the East and South East who  found it difficult getting to Birmingham last year. The venue is close to Kings Cross and Euston so is still easy to get to from the North and the Midlands. We aim to put the spotlight on the existential threat to public transport and active travel as the Government cuts funding in order to allow it to build more roads. This is while the potholes on local roads get ever bigger. At the same time The Government has ordered Network Rail not to replace worn out infrastructure, creating a short term saving but costing more in the long term. The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.W﻿e also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.T﻿AN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen. We hope it will cement friendships and empower the large number of people who have been campaigning at a grassroots level over the past few years.If you would like to reclaim your entrance ticket and rail fare we do have a small amount to pay for bursaries.

About Face," ""About Face,"" is a thought-provoking exhibition that basks in its flatness, challenging viewers to consider the role of dimension and form."," July 1, 2023, 4:00 PM"," July 28, 2023, 6:00 PM"," 7358 Beverly Boulevard Los Angeles, CA 90036",LA,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/about-face-tickets-614600034247,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/artspace-warehouse-29991587742,"artspacewarehouse.com@artspaceware Artspace Warehouse presents About Face, a thought-provoking group exhibition that basks in its flatness. Through a curated selection of works that are both physically and visually flat, this show challenges the viewer to consider the role of dimension and depth in our perception of beauty and form. Given the rise of high-quality printers and AI-generated art, flat paintings get misconstrued as artificially created and may even be considered of lesser value without the presence of the artist’s hand. Despite these notions, these artists have perfected their painting techniques, giving rise to a pristine flatness in their work, which can only be achieved with each artist’s individual aplomb. With an emphasis on geometry and color within his artworks, British artist Paul Westacott takes inspiration from the sunny California landscape to create his abstract paintings. The dialogue between color, form, line, and repetition is the vocabulary that explores visual relationships. The rainy climate of northern England where he grew up shaped his appreciation and captivation with the light and color of Southern California. When creating his works and choosing colors, he seeks to have the colors themselves inspire joy and transformation. In addition to being an artist, Westacott has enjoyed a career as a creative designer in the film and entertainment industries as well as working as a Disney “Imagineer.”Born in New York in 1964, Jodi Fuchs is an award-winning contemporary abstract painter living in St. Petersburg, Florida. Her education about color and pattern came on the job while working as a decorative painter for 20+ years in Los Angeles. Fuchs creates modern abstract expressionistic pieces that have an undeniable energy. Her medium is acrylic on canvas or panel, and she often uses spray paint, ink, and oil stick to enhance the work. It is Fuchs’ fascination with the pure creative force: understanding it, harnessing it, and expressing it, that fuels her painting process. Years of inquiry into the metaphysical aspects of life have influenced her studio practice. Experimentation is a central part of Julie Naima’s practice. Naima pulls inspiration from the magical places of the world, both real and fable, experienced in her travels and through her inner child’s imagination. From here, Naima imbues good intentions and positive emotions onto her canvas through her focus on color and shape. Her works are glimpses into her playful imaginary world where Naima invites the viewers to connect with the painting through their emotional response and answer the invitation to a dialogue about hope and happiness. Julie’s work can be found in private collections throughout Canada, Europe, Australia, and the USA.Will Beger's contemporary-minimalist paintings take on a new approach to southwest art. Influenced by his youth and inspired by nature, he effortlessly captures a vibrant, bohemian aesthetic that is unapologetically true to his inner child. His modern Southwest artworks feature a mix of mid-century modernism and landscape motifs with an emphasis on desert minimal design. Through stark contrasts between bold, monochromatic backgrounds and subject matter, Beger paints for himself, while also seamlessly connecting with anybody and everybody.Danny Brown is a first-generation American artist born in Los Angeles. Danny Brown’s artworks allocate an intrinsic connection between himself and the diverse communities occupying Los Angeles. Brown’s art coalesces youth culture, art history, fashion, and American consumerism and melds them all to create his unique style. Instantly relatable and recognizable, his cathartic paintings represent contemporary issues as well as a demographic that is traditionally underrepresented in fine art. Through his experience with graffiti, Brown became fluent in the use of color blocking and translating rougher imagery into something vibrant. His works speak to young Americans and inspire a whole new generation of art collectors and admirers.Combining her love for abstract art and the act of finding beauty in everyday life, local artist Courtney Simone creates cheerfully inspired abstract figurative artworks. Within her work, she walks the line between relatable day-to-day scenes and the fantastical. Her intuitive mark-makings and stylistic distortion of her female subjects marry the concepts of familiar comfort and discovery. As she creates each distinctive painting, she gives herself permission to explore and play with colors, subject matter, and composition leading to artworks full of joy and whimsy.Since the opening of Artspace Warehouse in 2010, the gallery continues to be an industry leader in affordable, museum-quality artworks making collecting art accessible and budget-friendly. With one gallery in Zurich and two galleries in Los Angeles, Artspace Warehouse specializes in guilt-free international urban, pop, graffiti, figurative, and abstract art. The expansive 5,000-square-foot space offers a large selection of emerging and established artists from all over the world.",

These contractors are subject to multiple cybersecurity requirements which live in various contract clauses. With the DOD intending to establish an independent cybersecurity verification regime known as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”), there is now a palpable risk that companies which do not address defense contract cybersecurity requirements may be unable to participate in future DOD acquisition contracts. To help support and sustain Southern California DIB, Ankura Consulting Group and Summit 7 Systems have partnered to bring quarterly CMMC events to the area. These regular CMMC events will feature:•	Focused compliance working sessions on managing regulated data, including Controlled Unclassified Information (“CUI”) and export-controlled data (i.e., ITAR, EAR);•	Focused technical working sessions on how small to mid-sized (“SMB”) DIB companies can practically implement the requirements of NIST SP 800-171;•	Governance working sessions developing best practices for SMBs to ensure they are right-sizing their compliance efforts to maximize effectiveness, efficiency, and cost savings; and•	Networking sessions for SMB DIB companies to speak with industry peers and exchange best practices and lessons learned in a climate of cooperation.About Ankura Consulting GroupAnkura Consulting Group is a global management consulting firm focused on helping companies protect, create, and recover value. Ankura’s National Security, Trade & Technology (“NSTT”) Practice works with defense contractors to effectively meet various compliance requirements, including: (i) Defense contract cybersecurity requirements (CUI, CMMC, NIST SP 800-171); (ii) international trade controls (ITAR, EAR); (iii) federal cloud security requirements (“FedRAMP”); (iv) federal secure software development requirements (“SSDF”); and (v) foreign direct investment mitigation and monitoring (“CFIUS”). Ankura’s NSTT practice is comprised of former prime contactor C-Suite executives and in-house counsel, former federal prosecutors, aerospace and defense engineers, cybersecurity experts, and international trade control experts. Ankura’s NSTT team has helped numerous contractors design, build, assess, and sustain effective compliance programs to meet the numerous regulatory and contract requirements associated with defense contracting.About Summit 7 SystemsSummit 7 is a national leader in cybersecurity, compliance, and managed services for the Aerospace and Defense industry and corporate enterprises.

In 1995, they released the Fuente Fuente Opus X, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest cigars in the world. The Opus X was created by Carlos Fuente Jr., who was inspired by the rich soil and climate of the Dominican Republic. He wanted to create a cigar that would showcase the best of what the country had to offer. The Opus X is made with a unique blend of tobaccos, including a rare Corojo wrapper that is grown under shade. This gives the cigar a distinctive flavor that is both complex and full-bodied. The Opus X is also known for its limited production. Each year, only a few thousand cigars are made, which makes them highly sought-after by cigar smokers. The Opus X has won numerous awards, including Cigar Aficionado's "" Cigar of the Year"" in 1996. It is consistently ranked among the top cigars in the world, and it is considered by many to be the pinnacle of cigar perfection.The Cigar of the Night: Arturo Fuente Destino Siglo de Pasion Opus X 100thThe Arturo Fuente Destino Siglo de Pasion Opus X 100th An is a limited-edition cigar that was released in 2013 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Arturo Fuente cigar brand. It is made with a Habano seed wrapper that is grown under shade, as well as Dominican binder and filler tobaccos. The cigar is medium to full-bodied, with a strong peppery profile that is accompanied by notes of dark chocolate, leather, cocoa, and a slight earthiness. It has a long and lingering finish, with hints of spice and oak. And it is considered to be one of the best cigars that Arturo Fuente has ever made.History of The Macallan DistilleryAh, the story of Macallan, a tale as rich and smooth as the whisky itself, laddie. Back in 1824, it was Alexander Reid, a humble barley farmer, who laid the foundations of the Elchies Distillery, later to be known as the world-renowned Macallan. Passing from hand to hand, the distillery found its true purpose under Roderick Kemp, a visionary who saw the potential in Macallan's fertile ground and turned it into a revered single malt producer. Through the decades, Macallan grew, always cherishing the importance of 'terroir', even growing its own barley on their verdant estate. Its fame grew, not just as a contributor to blended whiskies, but as a premium single malt. Macallan's passion for quality extended to its cask management, with a fondness for Spanish oak seasoned with sherry, lending their whisky a distinct flavor and natural color. Come 2018, they raised a toast to innovation, opening a cutting-edge distillery that embodied their respect for tradition and the natural world. Macallan, in its essence, is a testament to quality, setting records and benchmarks in the world of whisky, just as yours truly did in the world of cinema.Showcased WhiskeysMacallan 15 year:This whisky is a part of Macallan's Sherry Oak range, which features whiskies matured exclusively in hand-picked sherry seasoned oak casks from Jerez, Spain.

This whisky is characterized by its rich mahogany color and exhibits a complex aroma with hints of dried fruits, ginger, and toffee. Its flavor is rich and robust, with notes of dried fruits, spice, and chocolate, leading to a lingering finish of warm spice and mature oak.Macallan Harmony Arabica:The Macallan Whisky Maker Steven Bremner and The Coffee Collective. The whisky is aged for 18 years in a combination of European and American oak casks that previously held bourbon and sherry. This imparts a complex and harmonious flavor profile, with notes of ground coffee, hazelnut, sweet raisin, and vanilla. The finish is long and lingering, with hints of spice and oak.Macallan Harmony Cacao:The Macallan Harmony Collection Rich Cacao is a single malt Scotch whisky that was created in collaboration with the renowned pastry chef, Jordi Roca. The whisky is aged for 22 years in a combination of European and American oak casks that previously held sherry. This imparts a complex and harmonious flavor profile, with notes of chocolate fondant, honey, oak, zesty lime and ginger. The palate is rich and creamy, with flavors of dark chocolate, honey, dates, vanilla and cinnamon. The finish is long and lingering, with hints of spice and chocolate. A Brief on the Don Carlos Reserve Superior Limitada, “The Mans 80th”The Arturo Fuente Don Carlos Edicion de Aniversario 80th The Man’s 80th is a limited-edition cigar that was released in 2014 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Carlos Fuente Sr., the patriarch of the Arturo Fuente cigar family.

Following a split with MeatJack another 7"" EP entitled Hemp For Victory (Named after the vintage educational/propaganda film of the same name) was released on Thunder Lizard. Two more splits followed the same year and eventually Bongzilla was signed to Relapse Records.
The first release on this label was Methods for Attaining Extreme Altitudes released on CD on 27 January 1998. The band at this point made yearly appearances at the Milwaukee Metalfest, notably 1999 and 2000. The band's debut studio album Stash saw it's release on 20 April 1999 to positive reviews. A split with Corrupted, Noothgrush and Dystopia entitled Twin Threat To Your Sanity followed.
The band's second album saw release via Howling Bull America (With a reissue three years later via Relapse). Apogee was released on 11 May 2001 and showcased three new songs along with live recordings from 1998. A compilation of all of the band's EPs and splits to that point entitled Shake: The Singles saw release the next year. The band's third album Gateway saw release via Relapse on 3 September 2002.
Bongzilla would begin 2003 as part of the Relapse Contamination Festival, with their performance being released as a live album the next year. The band sporadically played shows and tours, with notable appearances at various festivals.
A lineup change prompted one Dixie Dave Collins to join the band as their bassist, leading them to record the band's fourth album. Amerijuanican was released via Relapse on 27 September 2005 to positive reviews and featured a cover of ""Champagne and Reefer"" by Muddy Waters. The band toured and remained active until 2009 when the group quietly took a hiatus, their last known show being Forward Fest alongside the likes of Bob Mould, Detroit Cobras and Neko Case to name a few.


In April 2015 it was announced Bongzilla was reforming with the Gateway lineup, first announcing a tour of Europe including dates at Heavy Days in Doomtown and Temples Festival along with a single date in NYC. The band followed up with a four-date tour of the West Coast USA, a tour of the east coast USA and an appearance at Desertfest Belgium.

Bongzilla began 2017 with a local show in Wisconsin before embarking on another European tour, playing the likes of Roadburn Festival, DesertFest Berlin, DesertFest London, KrisionFest (Their first ever appearance in Spain) and have begun working on material for a new album. Bongzilla have also set course for a 2018 European tour with Dopethrone and Sons of Otis. Bongzilla would tour and perform several festivals in 2018 and 2019. In late 2018 Totem Cat Records would release a 14 song compilation of the Bongzilla early split / live material under the album name Thank You Marijuana. In early 2020, Bongzilla started their own label called Gungeon Records and released a re-issue of their classic album Apogee. However, in March of 2020 it would be announced that Cooter Brown would retire from the band due to health and family reasons, with Bongzilla choosing to continue as a thunderous three-piece. During Bongzilla's first tour as a thunderous three in March of 2020, the tour was cut short due to a the coronavirus pandemic. A few months into the pandemic, Bongzilla began rehearsing and recording for several different record projects - A limited Wake Brewing 7 inch, a full length album titled Weedsconsin, an LP split with the band Tons, and a 7 Inch Split with Boris, the first of a 7 inch Split Series released on Gungeon Records. All projects were recorded at Future Apple Tree Studios in Rockford, Illinois in October of 2020 by the legendary John Hopkins before his sudden and unexpected passing in the late fall of 2020. Bongzilla announced signing to the Italian label - Heavy Psych Sounds on Janurary 21st of 2021. Bongzilla is preparing for the release of their new full length album Weedsconsin, as well as a limited 7 Inch from Wake Brewing, followed by the Bongzilla / Tons Split for the HPS series - Doom Sessions, as well as the 7 inch split with Boris that will come out on Gungeon Records. All releases are scheduled to drop in 2021.

Following this inspiration, we will explore who is responding to Lynn Margulis’s work. Anna Tsing is one such person. A﻿nna Tsing proposes we acknowledge fungi and mushrooms as feminist multi-species companions to learn the arts of living on a damaged planet.Our next discussion will read her short Mushrooms as Companion Species, a 2012 paper published before her book The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins (2015).She invites us to question the big stories that maintain the status quo. We are already entangled in fungi’s ways of living, what if we embraced this entangling instead of frivolously trying to detach ourselves, attempting to assert dominance? How do fungi change how think of gender, race, families, governance, and even love? We have since learned there are so many ways to be in relationships with fungi than just foraging – so we will weave together what we've learned where Anna Tsing gave us fertile (full of compost) ground to think from.A﻿bstract: ""Unruly Edges: Mushrooms as Companion Species"" “Human nature is an interspecies relationship. In this essay, Haraway’s concept of companion species takes us beyond familiar companions to the rich ecological diversity without which humans cannot survive. Following fungi, we forage in the last ten thousand years of human disturbance history with feminist multispecies company. Cereals domesticate humans. Plantations give us the subspecies we call race. The home cordons off inter- and intra-species love. But mushroom collecting brings us somewhere else—to the unruly edges and seams of imperial space, where we cannot ignore the interspecies interdependencies that give us life on earth. There are big stories to tell here, and they should not be left to the human triumphalists who control the field. This essay opens a door to multispecies landscapes as protagonists for histories of the world.""B﻿efore the discussion we invite you to:R﻿ead ""Unruly Edges: Mushrooms as Companion Species"" (﻿issues reported with the link above for some folks – so here's a secondary link to the paper above originally posted on the author's blog: https://tsingmushrooms.blogspot.com/)W﻿hat the heck is a Companion Species?Donna *Haraway’s term for the mutually dependent—Haraway’s term is ‘obligatory’—relationship between human animals and certain kinds of non-human animals. Companion species differs from companion animals (such as guide dogs for the blind) in this crucial respect: it implies a two-way dependency. Haraway argues that neither human animals nor non-human animals pre-exist their relationship to one another. This is because the relationship is productive or co-constitutive. Haraway takes this line of thought back to the origin of both humans and dogs and argues that their development has to be seen as an instance of co-evolution. Neither species would be what it is today without the other. Humans are in a state of coexistence with countless microorganisms, Haraway argues, so ‘our’ sense of ‘self’ needs to be rethought (she describes this as a fourth Copernican turn).F﻿or more, check out Haraway's Companion Species Manifesto>﻿>>Join our mycelial network: Sign up for our Substack email newsletter.Follow Exploring the Mycoverse on instagram.",

The creative process of the artistic piece consists of four strategies: choreographic studies inspired by Orixá mythology, music and dance investigations, spatial reimaginings of the conventional theater stage, and storytelling sessions with spiritual elders.Set Times: 6﻿pm: DJ Muñeka7﻿pm: Viver BrasilFor Location, Parking & FAQ, click hereAbout Vera Passos:Hailing from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, Passos is a pioneering choreographer, seasoned teacher, and acclaimed performer whose deep-seated relationship with Afro-Brazilian movement and music sets her apart in the field of contemporary dance.

You will also have an opportunity to help with the composting processes. Attending the one-hour orientation is required to gain access to the bin. You will receive a member agreement and then gain the ability start dropping-off your food scraps.About UsWhen Lancaster Compost Co-Ops was started in April 2021, Lancaster residents had zero alternatives to divert organic food and garden scraps from the general waste stream beyond individual backyards. Composting is a mainstream activity in American cities – and we believed it was high time for Lancaster to address the existing community interest.LCC currently has five co-op sites in Lancaster City. Each site has a critter proof and smell proof compost bin in a public space that allows trained community members to create high quality compost. A local community member, or ""captain,"" independently runs the site with the support of the community participants.To learn more, check out our website (www.lancastercompost.us) or Instagram (LancasterCompost).

Her work is included in numerous private collection, and was recently featured at the Hylton Performing Arts Center at George Mason University.  The curator of the George Mason show described Patricia’s work as being “defined by the subtle and sophisticated use of materials and abstract forms to evoke spiritual, linguistic, and natural phenomena. A main theme running through all of Underwood’s bodies of work has been the use of her own unique symbols that she developed early in her career. Starting with Japanese kanji, it built to include unique signs of music and movement, as well as symbols from ancient caves and rock carvings. Throughout her career, Underwood has incorporated and developed these symbols into distinct series of artworks with content and imagery that span ideas related to prehistoric signs of life, lullabies, the female body image and its representation, communication and conflict, and most recently trees and their relationship to humans and climate change.”",

Jocelyn and Megan’s careers in the wine industry converged at a small Italian inspired winery in southwestern Virginia. Their vision in 2021 grew from grapes without a home, a winery with space available, and meraki- a Greek word for doing something with soul, creativity, or love; to leave a piece of yourself in your work. Jocelyn and Megan are part of a new generation of winemakers and wine brands who see an opportunity to continue to transform the typical archetype of a male owned and operated wine business. They are standing on shoulders of women who blazed a trail in the Virginia wine and cider industries and, with the launch of Daring Wine Company, Jocelyn and Megan are continuing to shape their own future in this industry. They started with two single vineyard wines, a Chardonnay and a Barbera, grown from grapes at Stanburn Vineyard Inc., and a dry cider produced from a blend of cider apples grown in central Virginia. Heron Hill WineryHeron Hill has been producing delicious cool-climate wines from the Finger Lakes for nearly 50 years.  They make outstanding riesling, chardonnay, blaufrankish, pinots, and more.  So why include them in a Northern Virginia wine geek Bar Takeover?  We think you know why.  Their winemaker, Jordan Harris, did wonderful things at Tarara Winery in Northern Virginia for nearly a decade, and his winemaking left an impression on the Walsh team.  This is our excuse to get him back in the building.

We’re all “waiting for the ice to melt,” submitting to the chaos. What’s the use? In a garden of lush experimental rock, Shady Bug invites us to imagine the end of the world as the end of our old selves: a swarm of snakes exiting a red-tinted bar in the Midwest. Shady Bug has shed its lizard skin. Shady Bug has stepped into their most confident era of artful noise and melodic vocal honesty, asserting their trademark harmony of harsh and sweet in 2023 with What’s the Use? on Exploding in Sound Records (NYC).Original members and guitarists Hannah Rainey and Ripple have been cultivating this juxtaposition together since 2017 in St. Louis, MO. Now, coming into her own as a musical leader, the complex compositions on What’s the Use? contain more of Rainey’s voice than any other Shady Bug album. Shady Bug’s current lineup has included bassist Chris Chartrand since 2018, and this is his first time recording with the band. St. Louis drummer Jack Mideke (Smidley, Jr. Clooney) recorded drums on What’s the Use? The four musicians recorded the EP with engineer Alex Molini (Pile, Stove) at the ""Pile HQ"" in Nashville in 2022.With each arrangement grounded by Rainey’s tough yet crystalline vocals, What’s the Use? guides listeners through the clash of exterior and interior worlds — anxiety about climate change, the end of a relationship, and the beginning of self-motivated clarity.https://shadybug.bandcamp.com/album/whats-the-use • Origin Of Speech —electronic dirges and hype darkness project of Bash and Ben based in DC• Homeschool Friend —nu duo made up of aiden from plastic sun and flo petite *all sales are final unless canceled or postponed*",

Staff and curators will be on site to engage in meaningful conversations and reflections about the exhibition. -﻿-At the Precipice considers the role of physical and emotional reactions in the era of climate disaster. Given the proliferation of dire headlines and a public response that vacillates between denial and fatalism, the exhibition explores the use of color, tactility, material, and data not to avoid or disguise the issues but to instead offer accessible entry points. Featured works utilize a wide scope of art and design methodologies to give shape to aspects of a daunting crisis as they interpret the real-world changes of rising temperatures, environmental destruction, forced migration, and the stark consequences of unsustainable lifestyles enjoyed by few at the expense of many. Included are works by Selva Aparicio, Morel Doucet, Zaria Forman, Luftwerk, Nathalie Miebach, Chris Pappan, Redemptive Plastics, The Tempestry Project (Chicago Collection), Migwa Nthiga, and Jean Shin. At the Precipice explores how it feels to inhabit an irreversibly damaged planet facing a precarious future and considers the purpose of art and design in understanding how our collective trajectory must rapidly change direction. The exhibition is curated by Colossal.",

Floatation Tank : Book your session!,"As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, you can experience John C. Lilly's Floatation Tank.", West Den Haag, za. 29 jul. 2023 12:00 - 14:00, West Den Haag,Amsterdam,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-floatation-tank-book-your-session-630875143537,https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/west-den-haag-8971175698,"‘In the province of the mind, in the inside reality, what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be discovered experientially and experimentally. When so determined these limits are found to be further beliefs to be transcended.’*As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, we are proud to offer visitors the opportunity to personally experience John C. Lilly's tank isolation technique. The original concept was devised by John Lilly as a research instrument in 1954. In the ensuing decades, Lilly would go on to simplify and perfect the solitude, isolation and confinement tank, making it safer to build and use even for those untrained in this kind of research. The floatation tank that is available for visitors to use was inspired by Lilly's original tank designs. The floatation tank is a medium for process. It removes 99% of sensory input sources, assisting the user in cultivating an awareness of their internal state of being and attuning to their senses within and without the tank. Similar to meditation, many people enter into a relationship with sensory deprivation practices with certain expectations about what is going to happen. 'All we can say to these people is — nothing will happen that you don’t already know about; nothing can happen that you will not allow to happen, i.e.: “What is forbidden is not allowed.”' The possibilities for application of the tank isolation technique are multiple, ranging from simple relaxation in the weightlessness of the salt solution, pain relief for individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and psychonautic exploration of consciousness, with many certainly yet to be discovered. The relative lack of contemporary awareness of and research into sensory deprivation is partially due to the inaccessibility of the medium to the public. Floatation centres are scarce and expensive. Especially centres that endeavour to create an environment conducive to exploration, experimentation and reflection are lacking. West hopes to become such an environment throughout the exhibition of the floatation tank, providing an (albeit temporary) embryonic escape through sensory deprivation from life in a cultural climate characterised by flagrant overstimulation. An impossible space for self-interrogation of The Deep Self. * John C. Lilly (1915-2001), The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, (Distributor).What to consider before booking a timeslot You will be in an enclosed space in the absence of light and sound for +/- 1 hour, so if you are claustrophobic or fear the dark this is something to consider. However, as there is no light influx whatsoever in the tank, the inside appears more spacious to the user than it is in reality. This often negates feelings of claustrophobia. Even if you are claustrophobic, please feel free to come give it a try. Your session can be stopped at any time if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. You will be suspended in a solution of Water, Magnesium Sulfate, and Hydrogen peroxide (<100ppm), maintained around 33-34 degrees Celsius (skin temperature). The solution has a neutral pH (7.1), compatible with that of human skin. The solution is filtered and treated between each user. However, if any of the following apply to you, we recommend you do not participate in this installation:You have open wounds anywhere on your body. This includes conditions such as scalp eczema, skin ulcers, yeast infections, or athlete’s foot. This is for your own well-being (seeing as the highly dense salt solution will sting quite a bit on open or irritated skin) and for the well-being of subsequent users of the floatation tank. The same naturally applies to any other infectious diseases.You are currently menstruating, are easily susceptible to urinary tract infections, or are in the process of healing from gender-affirming surgery. If you are pregnant, please consult your physician before booking a session.You suffer from diarrhea or gastroenteritis/are living with bladder or bowel incontinence.You have low blood pressure.You are epileptic.You are diagnosed with an acute psychological/psychiatric condition. Please consult your respective mental health professional here, do your research and use your best judgement.Any questions about particular conditions’ compatibility (such as specific physical disabilities) with floatation therapy can be directed towards the contact listed at the end of this information sheet. We strongly discourage any visitors from entering the tank under the influence of any and all mind-altering substances (excluding prescription medications taken at the behest of a medical professional). If the host is under the impression that you are in any way inebriated you will not be allowed inside the tank and your participation fee will not be refunded. The risks of this far outweigh whatever rewards you might have read about. The tank is wheelchair accessible, though please do inform us prior to your session if you require any particular assistance.Please be advised that you will be required to sign a liability waiver before entering the tank.  For more information, please contact us at kevin@westdenhaag.nl!P﻿lease arrive 15 minutes before your session!What to bringTowelFreshly washed bathing suit (optional)Slippers Bathrobe (optional)Shampoo and hairbrush (if you have long hair)Sunglasses for your way home (advisable)M﻿oisturiser - at least for the face/neck and hands, if not a lotion for the  entire body. This can also be applied later at home after your float. Especially important if you are prone to contact dermatitis. Magnesium sulfate is however generally well tolerated.It is necessary to shower before and after your session. Antibacterial soap is provided, but feel free to bring your own.It is best to limit your caffeine and nicotine intake the day of your float.Shaving the day of your float is also not advisable, as the salt solution may sting and cause irritation on freshly shaven skin.",

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals.

Jardetzky, a renowned researcher and educator whose flourishing scientific career in Europe was halted by World War II and revived after he emigrated to the United States. From 1949 until his death in 1962, he was a research associate at Lamont-Doherty, where he collaborated with Frank Press, former president of the National Academy of Sciences, and Maurice Ewing, Lamont-Doherty's founder, on a well-known and widely used scientific book, Elastic Waves in Layered Media.
Dr. Jardetzky's broad scope of scientific interests also included celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, theoretical physics, seismology, and the migration of the poles. A principal contribution to science was his mathematical theory on zonal rotation, which provided a mechanism for the migration of continents.
The Jardetzky lecture was established in 1992 by Dr. Jardetzky's son Oleg, who was the founder of the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and professor of molecular pharmacology at Stanford University. In endowing the lectureship, Dr. Jardetzky said he hoped it would ""help enrich the outstanding tradition of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which provided a much cherished intellectual home to my father after he emigrated to this country.""

In discussions on Just Transition, green jobs become the priority. However this roundtable discussion will take the dialogue beyond jobs into life-skills. Green jobs and greening of the transition is just piece of the puzzle, but the larger share is our collective commitment towards the planet. To foster this commitment, global citizenship education provides the pathways to take care of our planet and all living beings. Therefore this round table discussion will include green jobs needed for livelihoods, but it also include all the elements of SDG target 4.7 which talks about the role of education in a peaceful and prosperous planet.
