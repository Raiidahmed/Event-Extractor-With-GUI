China: Confrontation or Cooperation?,"August 09, 2023, 06:00 PM","August 09, 2023, 08:00 PM","77 West Washington Street, Chicago, IL 60602","The US-China relationship is important for the well-being of both countries, and for the Chicago area. We share many goals, like addressing climate change and public health crises, not to mention reducing the likelihood of nuclear confrontation. Despite these deeply shared self-interests, the relationship between the two countries has grown increasingly tense.Congress established a committee to boost competition with China. A Chinese balloon entered US airspace, and the US shot it down. Nancy Pelosi took a controversial trip to Taiwan, and China retaliated with military exercises. These events and others have led many to be deeply concerned that a new Cold War - or worse - is on its way.   Join Chicago Area Peace Action, the Quincy Institute, and CODEPINK for a discussion about what’s going on between China and the United States, and how communities like ours can work to encourage diplomacy and cooperative engagement - and to avoid the horrors of war. Panelists: Jake Werner, Quincy Institute: Jake Werner is a Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute. He researches the emergence of great power conflict between the US and China and develops policies to rebuild constructive economic relations.Jodie Evans, CODEPINK: Jodie is co-founder of CODEPINK and founded the campaign China Is Not Our Enemy. She has traveled to China 10 times in the last 4 years. Jodie is primarily focused on sharing a global vision for peace and social justice.Steve Kranig, Logistics Professional: Steve Kranig is an executive with over 25 years of experience in the logistics and supply chain industry. He works with both imports and exports from the United States to world markets with a heavy focus on China.

In-Person: Poetry Reading with Sally Wen Mao & Natalie Eilbert,"September 01, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 01, 2023, 08:30 PM","5233 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60640","Please join us for an in-person poetry reading to celebrate the release of THE KINGDOM OF SURFACES by Sally Wen Mao and OVERLAND by Natalie Eilbert! In The Kingdom of Surfaces, award-winning poet Sally Wen Mao examines art and history—especially the provenance of objects such as porcelain, silk, and pearls—to frame an important conversation on beauty, empire, commodification, and violence. In lyric poems and wide-ranging sequences, Mao interrogates gendered expressions such as the contemporary “leftover women,” which denotes unmarried women, and the historical “castle-toppler,” a term used to describe a concubine whose beauty ruins an emperor and his empire. These poems also explore the permeability of object and subject through the history of Chinese women in America, labor practices around the silk loom, and the ongoing violence against Asian people during the COVID-19 pandemic.Natalie Eilbert's anticipated third collection, Overland, invokes elegy and psalm to speak to assault on the bodies of women and our planet. In a collection that is part warning, part rumination, Eilbert snapshots violence -- the scorch marks on California lumber, the discarded tools used to arrest climate change activists, the crescent moons on skin photographed by a forensic nurse. A chronicling of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and death cycles of the Great Barrier Reef, Overland maps an industry-scarred landscape that travels from coast to coast only to pause on the Congress floor where we are made to recognize: ""Disappearance is active loss."" Whether collective or private, environmental or familial, in Overland no loss is overlooked as sestinas and sonnets are interspersed with weary reportage on the power and limits of witness. Sally Wen Mao is the author of the forthcoming poetry collection The Kingdom of Surfaces (Graywolf Press, 2023), and the debut fiction collection Ninetails (Penguin Books). She is also the author of two previous poetry collections, Oculus (Graywolf Press, 2019), a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and Mad Honey Symposium(Alice James Books, 2014). The recipient of two Pushcart Prizes and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, she was recently a Cullman Fellow at the New York Public Library and a Shearing Fellow at the Black Mountain Institute. Natalie Eilbert is the author of Overland (Copper Canyon Press, 2023), her third poetry collection. A poet and journalist, Eilbert has received fellowships from the Wisconsin Institute of Creative Writing and the National Endowment for the Arts. Poems from Overland have been published in The New Yorker, POETRY, American Poetry Review, The Nation, and elsewhere. Her articles and essays have been published in Green Bay Press-Gazette, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, USA Today, Better Government Association, The Rumpus, Granta, The Lifted Brow and elsewhere. Born and raised in New York, she lives in Wisconsin as the statewide mental health reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.Accessibility: This event will be at the bookstore, which is a wheelchair accessible space.

The Women's Convention 2023,"October 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","October 22, 2023, 01:00 PM","400 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53203","We’re at an inflection point in our country. What we do in the next five years will impact the next five decades. If we are going to protect our personal rights, our communities, and democracy itself, we need to build the biggest movement possible. We need to consolidate women and allies around shared values, experience, and culture to build a nation that works for all of us. The 2023 Women’s Convention will provide a space for you to rejuvenate and find connection and support. Whether you are brand new to social change work or a veteran activist, this space is built for you.  You will gain tools, make connections, and experience the feminist future we want to live in. While Women’s March is a key vehicle for the new power of everyday women, our Women’s Convention connects you to the network of the movement and equips you with the skills, training, and opportunities you’ll need to become change agents in your own communities.  Learn more: www.thewomensconvention.com FAQsWhat is the Women's Convention?The Women’s Convention is a weekend of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, creative expression, and intersectional movement building. It will be a place where cause, community, and creativity intersect. We will provide a space where people can meet, share common interests, and engage on issues of civic engagement, accelerated by pop culture. We will engage activists by melding traditional organizing programming with non-traditional programming, including salons, art spaces, screenings, social programming, and women’s workforce development. This convention will leverage the power of culture shift through skilling up and storytelling to create an empowered space of feminist momentum. This event will mobilize and unite movements for gender justice, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and environmental justice and bring thousands of participants to combine activism and creative expression among everyday people. When and where is it? The Women’s Convention will run from Friday, October 20, to Sunday, October 22, 2023. The location is the Baird Center in Milwaukee, WI. Visit  www.thewomensconvention.com  to learn more about transportation, lodging, and to find our feminist guide to visiting Milwaukee.How much does it cost?General admission is $350 per person—an amount that covers the full cost of entrance to the Women's Convention. If your employer is paying for your registration, we ask that you please register at the institutional level, $555 per person.

If you're interested in getting more information about scholarships, please click here.Why Wisconsin? We’re continuing to build on the success of the 2022 Women’s Convention by hosting it in Wisconsin for 2023 & 2024. Wisconsin is a vitally important state in 2024. Referred to as the incubator for our country’s tribal politics, many pundits think that Wisconsin is one of the states that will be both a deciding factor in the 2024 Presidential election and one that demonstrates the deep polarization that characterizes U.S. politics. With strong organizing, Wisconsin is flippable and Women’s March has the ability to make an impact on the outcome of the election. Women’s March has been making strategic interventions in Wisconsin since 2022, through both mobilizations and electoral strategies. The Women’s Convention will continue that investment with those women and communities who are the backbone and future of Wisconsin. We know that Women’s March belongs to our marchers and that they are the ones that make a change in whatever place they call home. We can support, connect, and amplify what they are doing and can do in their own backyards.Who will be there?The Women’s Convention will bring together over a thousand everyday women activists, allies, movement leaders, rising political stars that reflect our nation’s changing demographics, and thousands of new grassroots leaders who’ve organized in their communities and taken to the streets since January 2017. We hope to make this one of the largest convenings of its kind, and a unique opportunity for everyday women and our allies—from all backgrounds, and experiences—to learn together, share expertise, and unite around collective goals and strategies.What is the program? What can attendees expect? We are developing a program of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, and intersectional movement building based on the input, ideas, and efforts of organizers from our grassroots movements. Attendees—regardless of prior experience—can expect to be inspired, challenged, connected, and educated. The goal of the Women’s Convention is for participants to leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills, and strategies for working towards a collective feminist future. Visit www.thewomensconvention.com  for up-to-date programming information. Want to submit a workshop or idea for consideration? Visit www.thewomensconvention.com Where can I stay?Women's March has negotiated a limited amount of discounted room rates at the Hilton and Doubletree Hotels, both across the street from the convention center.  Visit www.thewomensconvention.com to book directly and take advantage of these rates.Will there be a live-stream?Yes. Selected events will be live-streamed. Are people of all faiths welcome?The Women’s Convention is open to people of all or no religious faiths. We will have space to accommodate for observance and prayer.Will the convention be accessible for disabled participants?Yes! We are working hard to make sure the convention is inclusive and accessible. The Baird Center is ADA-compliant.

There is no guest list at the boat, each ticket must be scanned. Security reserves the right to inspect all bags and persons. Absolutely no outside food or beverage may be brought on the boat. Guests who are deemed intoxicated (or otherwise unfit) upon arrival, will be denied entry and no refunds will be given. We want all guests to enjoy themselves on the cruise, but please note you will be on the boat for an extended amount of time and our number one priority is the safety of all guests. The boat will depart the dock as soon as boarding is completed. Once the boat begins its cast off procedure, for the safety of all guests, absolutely no late arrivals will be allowed within the security fence to board. If you are late, you will be left at the harbor without a refund. In the event of dangerous weather conditions, security situations, mechanical issues with the locks, the boat, etc., the boat may not cruise, but the event will still go on at the dock. In the event of rain, or other inclement weather, the event will continue on the enclosed portion of the boat. Any ticketing/technical issues will be handled by Eventbrite.com. Please contact them directly at https://www.eventbrite.com/contact-us/. Sorry – no refunds or price adjustments. The Eventbrite system does not allow us to restrict people who are underage from buying tickets. If you are not 21 and purchase a ticket, you will not be allowed on board. Cruise length will vary based upon multiple factors, including, but not limited to: boarding time, lock operations, boat traffic, weather, special events such as fireworks, emergency situations, etc. The music's volume level will be set to an acceptable level intended to please all guests and may be regulated/limited by safety regulations set forth by the captain.
