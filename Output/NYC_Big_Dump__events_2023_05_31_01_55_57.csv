            Climate LIVE K12: Harnessing the Power of Communities to Fight Flooding and Protect Our Waterways 
Climate LIVE K12 (formerly EI LIVE K12) is dedicated to bringing the science of sustainability to K12 students, educators, and parents.
About this Event 
Presenter:  Paul Gallay, Senior Staff Associate and Resilient Coastal Communities Project Leader, Center for Sustainable Urban Development 
Target Audience: Grades 9-12, Undergraduate, Educators, and the Public 
Climate-driven flooding is worsening due to sea level rise and rapidly intensifying storms, with many of the most serious impacts being felt in disadvantaged communities already reeling from decades of underinvestment in water quality and ecosystem health. To protect our most vulnerable communities, government planners must find new ways to respect and center the wisdom that only those communities possess. Can we build the just and equitable partnerships we'll need to survive climate change?
A link to join the session will be provided to all registered participants 24 hours in advance.

"Beyond Federally-Funded Buyouts – Local Policies, Tools and Funding",This virtual panel explores innovative approaches and tools for local governments and communities to overcome equity and implementation challenges associated with federal disaster resources.,2023-06-14 12:00,2023-06-14 13:30,Online Event,,TRUE,https://www.climate.columbia.edu/events/beyond-federally-funded-buyouts-local-policies-tools-and-funding,,,/Users/raiidahmed/Desktop/climate_tech_columbia_climate_nyc.csv,"Beyond Federally-Funded Buyouts – Local Policies, Tools and Funding Streams
While federal resources are critical for providing relocation support to thousands of people living in the U.S., national policies and programs are falling short in addressing the urgency, scale, and complexity of climate-driven displacement. When it comes to buyouts and property acquisitions, accessing federal funds poses significant challenges. Restrictive requirements and lengthy bureaucratic processes can hinder local governments from developing compassionate and locally-responsive programs that prioritize community needs. To overcome these hurdles, local governments can leverage local funding sources to reduce their reliance on federal disaster dollars. By diversifying funding sources, local governments can not only expand relocation assistance beyond individual home buyouts, but also align their programs with local values and broader resilience goals.

As the world transitions from consuming fossil fuels-based energy into low-carbon energy sources, demand for copper, lithium, nickel, and other minerals will increase for things like electric mobility, solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage. However, the world is not on track to get these minerals at current rates. The world’s demand for lithium is projected to increase by 40 times and that for copper to potentially double by 2040 relative to 2020 levels. 
Latin America has the world’s largest deposits of both copper and lithium. Chile and Peru are the world’s leading copper producers with about 40% of global production, while Chile and Argentina account for 32% of global lithium supply. However, Latin America faces a number of social, political, environmental, and financial challenges to increase its critical minerals extraction and processing capacity. 
The Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs will host a panel of experts to discuss what needs to be done to accelerate sustainable copper and lithium extraction in Latin American countries. This event will focus on the challenges and opportunities that governments and industry face to turn these mineral reserves into a bridge for the energy transition globally. Light refreshments will be provided.
Panelists:
María José Baptista, Interagency and Intergovernmental Affairs Officer, United Nations Environment Programme
Juan Carlos Jobet, Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy  at Columbia University SIPA; Dean, School of Business, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez; Former Minister of Energy and Mining, Chile
Tom Moerenhout, Research Scholar, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA; Adjunct Associate Professor of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University SIPA; Adjunct Assistant Professor, New York University Stern School of Business; Senior Advisor, World Bank

Decades later, she returns to kayak the river of her youth and tell its story.AMERICAN RIVER is a new 86-minute documentary film that follows Ms. Bruno and guide Carl Alderson on a 4-day, 80 mile adventure down the Passaic River, from its pristine source in a wildlife refuge to its toxic mouth in Newark Bay. The river’s amazing history, geology and ecology are revealed as the kayakers navigate challenges, travel through urban landscapes and head towards the industrial disaster that has poisoned the Passaic for the past 60 years.Along the way, the filmmakers engage residents, historians and advocates in candid conversations that bring insight, urgency and a sense of wonder to the story. How did the Passaic become one of the most contaminated rivers in America? Can it be saved? The Passaic is an archetype for thousands of rivers across America facing similar reckonings.After the documentary, you can ask questions of the movie’s producer, Scott Morris and the Hackensack Riverkeeper, Captain Bill Sheehan. Share your thoughts about how communities on and around the Hackensack River can be greener and healthier and better connect residents to their hometown river. Then join us for a reception in HACPAC’s art gallery.This program is sponsored by Visions Federal Credit Union.

They immediately spar like prize fighters trying not to get hit, but provocation leads to conflict and lust. Will both get what they want or will someone be exposed and left in a fetal ball of defeat?With a former Off Broadway run at the Strawberry Theatre Festival and a debut in the nation's capitol at The DC Black Theatre Festival, Jackson and the Sixth Fest are excited to once again present this prophet's timeless perspective in New York.Reviews:""...what makes Baldwin’s Ni$$er such a rewarding theatrical experience is not this sensational twist but the adroit way the play as a whole teleports to us the brilliance of James Baldwin.

In conversation with Christina Brophy.P﻿LEASE NOTE: This free event is first come, first served; RSVPs are encouraged. Seating is limited. Doors open at 5:30 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.Fueled by an abiding concern with environmental crisis for more than three decades, contemporary artist Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) depicts an ominous and complex vision of ocean life affected by humankind in a monumental new series titled Oceanus. Alexis Rockman: Oceanus takes the viewer on a global journey of discovery beneath the world's changing seas, through the artist's ethereal and sublime renderings of real and imaginary marine life within a fragile ecosystem. Published to accompany an ambitious traveling exhibition in North America and abroad, this volume documents Rockman's newly executed 8 x 24-foot panoramic painting Oceanus and ten related large watercolors, important works that tell the story of humanity's indelible relationship with the ocean and the connections between the sea and our own survival, as the artist deftly weaves natural history, art history, archaeology, adventure, political analysis, and science into a story about the human condition. Complementing this stunning presentation of Rockman's paintings--as well as many details and photographs documenting the artist's process, along with a rich selection of contextual imagery--are essays by leading writers and scholars on such topics as maritime and oceanic history and Rockman's work within the larger context of art history.
Alexis Rockman is a contemporary American painter known for his fantastical paintings of dystopian natural environments. Rockman tackles ecological issues—such as climate change and species extinction—through his large-scale artworks. Part-artist, part-activist, he confronts pressing social issues head on through carefully rendered paintings of animals and their rapidly changing environments.Christina Brophy is Senior Director of Museum Galleries and Senior Vice President of Curatorial Affairs at the Mystic Seaport Museum.",,,,,

Would you stop wearing your favorite color if you disagreed with the methods by which it was made? Are the colors and materials we use to depict the future in science fiction storytelling possible, given what we now know about their environmental impact? In this workshop, participants will dive into the exciting world of bacterial pigments and explore their integration into artwork through the dynamic techniques of block printing and silk screen printing. While thinking critically about their real world applications. We will cover the basics of how to select, grow and maintain the bacteria as your medium - and the challenges to the durability and life cycle of bacterially pigmented items.Hands-on sessions will be contextualized within a framework that maps the industrial and cultural histories of color and textile dyeing alongside current speculative and realworld trends in the production and utilization of biopigments.We will consider the science and sociopolitical forces driving industry at critical junctures leading to our current anti-fast-fashion climate. Our intention is to come away with an action each of us can do on our own, and that one person we know will adopt that brings us a little closer to a better fashion future. Participants will leave this workshop with:an appreciation for the connection between the materials of a pigment and their cultural meaning on our expectations of the aesthetics of the futureknowledge of the history and challenges to wide-spread adoption of biopigmentsa tote bag with their own design, printed with bacteria pigment (*participants may bring their own cotton or silk item to print on)alternative ways of thinking about the origins and meanings of colorsan informed perspective about how a color could go extinctCOVID-19 Safety Notice:If you are feeling unwell, suspect that you have been exposed to COVID-19 or have tested positive in the past 7 days, please do not attend and let us know ASAP (info@genspace.org).

Flushing Creek was artificially forced underground at sections into pipes for the construction of the 1939 World’s Fair grounds and now runs beneath and through the center of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Daylighting, or restoring underground portions of a waterway into above ground habitats, has immense benefits for social-ecological health and climate resilience.Organized by Guardians of Flushing Bay together with artist and educator Julia Norton, each of the four workshops in this series will be led by a different Queens-based artist selected through an open call. Some workshops will move through the park to examine Flushing Creek first hand, while others will remain in the museum to consider the waterway more broadly. The workshops will allow for exploration within a variety of artistic mediums, such as conceptual practice and hands-on art making. The goal of the workshops is to reveal Flushing Creek through visual materials and content that can be utilized in engaging local park users in the future possibility of daylighting Flushing Creek. These workshops will be designed for adults ages 18 and older. Any minors older than 12 are welcome to participate, but must be accompanied by an adult. All participants should be prepared for uneven terrain, long outdoor walks and muddy conditions. No prior experience is necessary.",,,,,

It is this image that we invoke in this project, of standing quietly on the beach and listening to the stories of the ocean, and the people who have an intimate relationship with it. Weaving the stories, histories and contemporary concerns of diverse South African coastal communities into an Empatheatre production, Lalela uLwandle explores themes of intergenerational environmental injustices, tangible and intangible ocean heritage, marine science and the myriad threats to ocean health.The performance sheds new light and hope on some of the well-known conundrums of ocean governance. Most noticeably it has surfaced intangible heritages of the ocean, and challenged evidence hierarchies in local law and international policy. Recently the audio play of Lalela uLwandle was used as evidence (along with two other short films from Empatheatre) in three court proceedings in legal cases against Oil and Gas giant Shell and the South African government in 2022. The play, was used as evidence to support the rich and powerful affidavits of small scale fishers and other ocean defenders in the case. This was the first time in SA history, that art was used as evidence in ocean governance, and found ways to represent indigenous intangible heritage in meaningful and inclusive ways. One of the most significant aspects of the play illustrates how natural and social scientists can collaborate with holders of different knowledge systems, respectfully and constructively, to develop a more integrated understanding of environmental challenges. The play also illuminates the close connections between human rights and ocean-climate governance, from the local to the international level. There will be a discussion with the audience after the performance, in which we look forward to engaging with different policy makers and publics, experts and stakeholders. During these discussions, we think critically about the importance of listening to and mutual learning among researchers, spiritual healers, small-scale fishers and other stakeholders, and how this can transform the way we understand unexplored connections to the ocean and its role in climate governance.  Lalela uLwandle is an invitation to a participatory public conversation on ocean governance in South Africa. It is funded under the One Ocean Hub, a five-country hub of researchers exploring more democratic methods of engagement in ocean governance.

Globally, there are around 100 million people without homes and 1.6 billion people living in unsuitable housing conditions. And these numbers are continually rising. The pandemic, migration, and the climate crisis have and will continue to have a negative influence on the rising number of the unhoused. In addition to economic and social measures, a notably significant factor is the environment in which the socially marginalized live. An important component of any interdisciplinary team, therefore, must include architects.What is the situation in the Czech Republic and in European cities? And what role do architects have in improving the situation? What innovative approaches can be used to integrate people with experience of homelessness back into society? The lecture will include a screening of three short films about selected projects from the Architecture of Coexistence series (by Architects without Borders, Czechia and artyčok.TV): Bedřiška, Ostrava (Czechia), VinziRast-mittendrin, Vienna (Austria), Bellevue di Monaco, Munich (Germany).Ing. arch.

As ESG issues become increasingly pertinent to both the developed and the emerging world, there is a greater need to quantity risk(s) emanating from company operations and developing tools to measure and manage ESG risks. Since the materiality of ESG issues differs by industry, a common quantification system to compare entity performance on ESG parameters is the need of the hour. This is important to have cross-entity evaluation as well. Quantifying ESG risk involves understanding relevant ESG factors for an entity, understanding each factor’s importance for the entity, assigning weights based on the importance, and then scoring an entity’s initiatives and measures to mitigate the ESG risk. The approach to quantify ESG risk works like a common currency to compare entities on a uniform scale and provide a quick idea about their management of ESG issues.

Though it is often framed in abstract terms—warming scenarios, emissions pathways, integrated assessment models for damages, and fuel mixes in the grid—it is rarely experienced this way. Rather, the global energy transition and the broader struggle for climate justice are often understood—and thus won or lost—in materialist terms: through investments in the buildings, landscapes, public works, and built environment that stitch together everyday life for most people. This is the proposition at the core of Green New Dealers’ program—to transform how and where we live and relate to one other by tackling carbon emissions and inequality at once. But these forces extend well beyond the boundaries of a parcel of building envelope where designers typically engage with questions of climate action. The technologies at the core of the energy transition—solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, battery farms, data centers, and advanced nuclear power—all depend on a planetary supply matrix of rare earth elements and critical minerals. These pockets of exceedingly valuable ore tend to be developed in the Global South—and especially in the most remote locations of the Global South, where rules, laws, and norms can be suspended or ignored by multinational mining companies without the scrutiny of local or international press. The poles of this process—the mines and the end-use technological deployments—are linked through a network of waste disposal sites, manufacturing hubs, renewable energy deployment zones, and the various labor and logistical forces that make them all possible.  One of those poles rests in South Greenland’s Kvanefjeld Mine—an erstwhile uranium mine that was key to the Allies’ postwar nuclear energy and weapons programs, that was subsequently decommissioned after decades of anti-mining militancy by a local group of Inuit activists known as Urani? Naamik! (Uranium? No thanks!). But prospectors have since discovered that the mine is home to the world’s second-densest deposit of rare earth elements and critical minerals that, coupled with Greenland’s postcolonial relationship with Denmark, and the region has entered a state of suspended reality as interested parties wait for the Danish court system to rule on exploitation licenses for the site. This lecture will situate Greenland within the global energy transition and implicate its future in that of the Global North. Put another way, this lecture will ask what it means for resource communities like Narsaq, Greenland for the U.S. and other imperial powers to pursue the kind of resource-intensive energy transition that is now underway. “Fire, Ice, and Ore” is presented as part of e-flux Architecture Lectures, a monthly series inviting researchers and practitioners to discuss timely issues in contemporary architecture, theory, culture, and technology.Billy Fleming is the founding Wilks Family Director of the Ian L. McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design.

Brown) are lifelong best friends, brothers from another mother– and the last two men on earth. Their survival is largely due to Ray, a brilliant scientist who designed a domed structure with all the systems necessary to sustain life on a planet that could no longer support it. Their custom biosphere is outfitted with basic necessities and creature comforts that make it possible to retain a sense of what life used to be like. A hydroponic garden provides fresh vegetables and a carefully managed fishpond supplies essential protein. Recently, however, fish have begun dying at an alarming rate. With a mere three fish remaining, Billy and Ray face an ominous future. But life may yet find a way.,Dr. Marcy Later has devoted her life to nuclear fusion, a long-proposed but never realized renewable energy solution for climate change. At a scientific conference in New Orleans with her two young children, she neglects her maternal and professional responsibilities by hanging out with a group of Furries, who are attending their own conference at the same hotel -- all while a major hurricane gathers strength offshore.Courtesy of IFC Films and AMC Networks.

In a theater in New York City, seven teens gather to put on a play because our world is burning and they have something to say about it. In this visceral and confronting new play, a cast of teenagers grapple with the realities of the world they are inheriting, hold the audience to account, and imagine new pathways forward together. Directed by Nick J. Browne with original music by Curtis Gillen, Is My Microphone On? is inspired by Greta Thurnberg and the tenacity of youth across the globe who are taking a stand for themselves and future generations. With music, confronting dialogue, and poetic language this play is a platform for the youth of New York to lift their voices, inspire dialogue regarding the climate crisis, and investigate how to heal a burning world if those in positions of power refuse to wake up and enact meaningful change now.

Rae Kelliher is a veteran environmental activist and pioneer in the death-with-dignity movement. Facing a diagnosis of terminal illness, she engages in a shocking suicide murder, taking the life of an oil company CEO for his role in delaying responses to climate disruption. Seven years later, Rae’s friends and family gather at her Vermont farm community to try to understand her violent exit and the rapid social transformations around them.I Want a Better CatastropheWith global warming projected to rocket past the 1.5°C limit, lifelong activist Andrew Boyd is thrown into a crisis of hope, and off on a quest to learn how to live with the “impossible news” of our climate doom. He searches out eight leading climate thinkers — from collapse-psychologist Jamey Hecht to grassroots strategist adrienne maree brown, eco-philosopher Joanna Macy, and Indigenous botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer — asking them: “Is it really the end of the world? and if so, now what?”About the Festival:Named after the sixth mass extinction event currently underway, the Sixth Fest has put on more than 40 events and productions in New York, Chicago, and online. From poetry to panels, pageants to protests, we are a fringe festival both in that we encourage people to create their own events, and that those events can be of whatever kind.

The Torch Ensemble is a new theater company started by Padraig Bond, Penelope Deen, Luis Feliciano, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor Lazar. The five of us met as theatre majors at Hunter College, a public university in New York City. Our mission is to premiere two of Padraig’s original plays, The Trash Garden and Debating Extinction, at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival this August. We have already been accepted into the festival, and have been offered fifteen performances at Greenside Venues, one of Edinburgh’s central theaters! We need your help to bring us there. The Edinburgh Fringe is the largest arts festival in the world, and we are using it as a jumpstart to our five careers like many artists have done before us, from Phoebe Waller-Bridge to Robin Williams to John Cleese to Alan Rickman.The Trash Gardena new play by Padraig Bonddirected by Padraig Bondstarring Luis Feliciano, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor LazarThe Trash Garden is an environmentalist comedy inverting Adam and Eve, and introducing us to the last two people left on Earth after climate change, Atlas and Evelyn. Trapped together in dystopia, they explore the meaning of their lives together through imagination, play, and reminiscences of the past. It is a play about human resilience, love and hate, isolation and friendship, environmental collapse, and of course, recycling.Debating Extinctiona new play by Padraig Bonddirected by Padraig Bondstarring Penelope Deen, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor LazarDebating Extinction is a bold romance about the modern question of whether or not to have children in the face of the climate crisis. Susan and Teddy are young lovers living post climate change, and are preparing to have a child to restart humanity, but they must keep it secret from Susan’s tyrannical, yet deeply environmentalist mother. It is a play about the future, about love and death, environmental collapse, and the spirit and true nature of humanity.Our performances will be:J﻿une 2-4, 2023N﻿ew Perspectives TheatreM﻿anhattan, NYCAugust 4 - 19, 2023Fern Studio, Greenside VenuesEdinburgh Fringe Festivalhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-our-work-to-the-edinburgh-fringe-festival",,,,,

Curated by Amanda + James in partnership with Asia Stewart, The third iteration of Summer happenings is centered on the theme of coastlines.Too often, many of us rush through New York City and forget that we live on a series of islands whose natural landscape has been adapted and shaped by generations of forgotten inhabitants.  We neglect our land’s past: the violence that resides in soil stolen from the Lenape people (including the Wappinger, Munsee Lenape, Schaghticoke, Canarsie, Matinecock, and Lekawe nations). We look past the waterways’ paths; many brush up against terminals, docks, and piers and have been constructed for and destroyed by cycles of trade, capital, and exchange. As coastal living becomes increasingly precarious with climate change, we hope you will consider the history, value, beauty, and fragility of our brackish borders.

Our goal is clear: together, we need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and stop burning fossil fuels. And we need to do this in a way that is equitable and just. Any one of the thousands of jobs that help with that is a climate career! You could focus on reducing GHG emissions in buildings - working in designing, construction, or clean energy. Or you could manage green space, by working in natural areas or agriculture. You might help us move toward “circularity” - reducing waste through repairing goods or reusing materials. Or you may help your community be more resilient. This means reducing peoples’ vulnerability to climate hazards.  Maybe you want to be an educator and teach people about climate change, or you love economics and want to help finance solutions. Maybe you’ll invent a solution no one knows about yet!  Whatever your interests, there is a climate career path for you. Participating Organizations We'll have representatives from over 20 different organizations, all focused on environment, climate, or green industries. Come learn about the different opportunities available in the NYC area and speak to workers who are taking climate action in their jobs!Student-Led WorkshopsW﻿e have optional, student-led workshops:Climate Communications in Your School Upcycling Workshop W﻿e'll also have a keynote speaker to talk about being a young climate professional, and activities like an eco-book swap!

This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.
