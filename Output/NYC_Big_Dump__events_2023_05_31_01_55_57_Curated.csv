In a theater in New York City, seven teens gather to put on a play because our world is burning and they have something to say about it. In this visceral and confronting new play, a cast of teenagers grapple with the realities of the world they are inheriting, hold the audience to account, and imagine new pathways forward together. Directed by Nick J. Browne with original music by Curtis Gillen, Is My Microphone On? is inspired by Greta Thurnberg and the tenacity of youth across the globe who are taking a stand for themselves and future generations. With music, confronting dialogue, and poetic language this play is a platform for the youth of New York to lift their voices, inspire dialogue regarding the climate crisis, and investigate how to heal a burning world if those in positions of power refuse to wake up and enact meaningful change now. This is the alarm.

Climate Cafe (6/1),Join us for a Climate Cafe on June 1st to discuss the difficult emotions that arise out of the ongoing climate emergency,6/1/23 18:30,6/1/23 20:00,"176 9th Avenue New York, NY 10011",NYC,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/climate-cafe-61-tickets-633635409567,/Users/raiidahmed/Desktop/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_nyc.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/climate-cafe-nyc-65667042983,"Join us for the NYC Climate Cafe on Thu Jun 1 at 6:30-8 PM  at 176 9th Avenue, New York, NY 10011. This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice. Contact us at @climatecafenyc on Instagram with any questions!"

Along with her colleagues, Gunn-Wright aims to create a body of work that examines the role of economic policy and large-scale economic transformation in catalyzing just and rapid responses to the climate crisis. She also supports Roosevelt’s engagement with the Green New Deal Network and other partners in the climate movement.Prior to joining Roosevelt, Gunn-Wright was the policy director for New Consensus, charged with developing and promoting the Green New Deal, and the policy director for Abdul El-Sayed’s 2018 Michigan gubernatorial campaign. A 2013 Rhodes Scholar, she has also worked as the policy analyst for the Detroit Health Department, acted as the Mariam K.

The Torch Ensemble is a new theater company started by Padraig Bond, Penelope Deen, Luis Feliciano, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor Lazar. The five of us met as theatre majors at Hunter College, a public university in New York City. Our mission is to premiere two of Padraig’s original plays, The Trash Garden and Debating Extinction, at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival this August. We have already been accepted into the festival, and have been offered fifteen performances at Greenside Venues, one of Edinburgh’s central theaters! We need your help to bring us there. The Edinburgh Fringe is the largest arts festival in the world, and we are using it as a jumpstart to our five careers like many artists have done before us, from Phoebe Waller-Bridge to Robin Williams to John Cleese to Alan Rickman.The Trash Gardena new play by Padraig Bonddirected by Padraig Bondstarring Luis Feliciano, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor LazarThe Trash Garden is an environmentalist comedy inverting Adam and Eve, and introducing us to the last two people left on Earth after climate change, Atlas and Evelyn. Trapped together in dystopia, they explore the meaning of their lives together through imagination, play, and reminiscences of the past. It is a play about human resilience, love and hate, isolation and friendship, environmental collapse, and of course, recycling.Debating Extinctiona new play by Padraig Bonddirected by Padraig Bondstarring Penelope Deen, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor LazarDebating Extinction is a bold romance about the modern question of whether or not to have children in the face of the climate crisis. Susan and Teddy are young lovers living post climate change, and are preparing to have a child to restart humanity, but they must keep it secret from Susan’s tyrannical, yet deeply environmentalist mother. It is a play about the future, about love and death, environmental collapse, and the spirit and true nature of humanity.Our performances will be:J﻿une 2-4, 2023N﻿ew Perspectives TheatreM﻿anhattan, NYCAugust 4 - 19, 2023Fern Studio, Greenside VenuesEdinburgh Fringe Festivalhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-our-work-to-the-edinburgh-fringe-festival"

Rae Kelliher is a veteran environmental activist and pioneer in the death-with-dignity movement. Facing a diagnosis of terminal illness, she engages in a shocking suicide murder, taking the life of an oil company CEO for his role in delaying responses to climate disruption. Seven years later, Rae’s friends and family gather at her Vermont farm community to try to understand her violent exit and the rapid social transformations around them.I Want a Better CatastropheWith global warming projected to rocket past the 1.5°C limit, lifelong activist Andrew Boyd is thrown into a crisis of hope, and off on a quest to learn how to live with the “impossible news” of our climate doom. He searches out eight leading climate thinkers — from collapse-psychologist Jamey Hecht to grassroots strategist adrienne maree brown, eco-philosopher Joanna Macy, and Indigenous botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer — asking them: “Is it really the end of the world? and if so, now what?”About the Festival:Named after the sixth mass extinction event currently underway, the Sixth Fest has put on more than 40 events and productions in New York, Chicago, and online.

As the world transitions from consuming fossil fuels-based energy into low-carbon energy sources, demand for copper, lithium, nickel, and other minerals will increase for things like electric mobility, solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage. However, the world is not on track to get these minerals at current rates. The world’s demand for lithium is projected to increase by 40 times and that for copper to potentially double by 2040 relative to 2020 levels. 
Latin America has the world’s largest deposits of both copper and lithium. Chile and Peru are the world’s leading copper producers with about 40% of global production, while Chile and Argentina account for 32% of global lithium supply. However, Latin America faces a number of social, political, environmental, and financial challenges to increase its critical minerals extraction and processing capacity. 
The Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs will host a panel of experts to discuss what needs to be done to accelerate sustainable copper and lithium extraction in Latin American countries. This event will focus on the challenges and opportunities that governments and industry face to turn these mineral reserves into a bridge for the energy transition globally. Light refreshments will be provided.

Their goal is to integrate full and equitable climate education across all areas of study and school culture.We have four workshops, facilitated by CELT Members, that can be applied in all grade levels and subjects:Workshop 1:  Planning and Implementing a Climate Action Day A Climate Teach-In is a great way to catalyze school-wide education and awareness about climate change. This session will provide ideas, guidance and year-long support for educators looking to facilitate school-wide events, and lay the foundation for a Climate Action Day, as called for PlaNYC(New York City's climate action strategic plan).Workshop 2: Accessing & Sharing Climate Resources Learn about CELT's monthly Climate Ed Digest which is packed full of resources to teach about climate education. We will show you how to access the documents and work on a fun hands-on project that can be modified for any grade. The session will also provide strategies to share climate communication with your colleagues.  Workshop 3:  Climate Education Advocacy 101 Develop your advocacy skills by refining a “pitch” to use at your own school to advance climate education. Learn the four key “asks” that the Advocacy subcommittee of CELT has identified, and the climate education goals in the Mayor’s recent PlaNYC. We will practice using advocacy skills in activities with your students and Green Teams turning our goals into actions! Workshop 4:  Easy Entryways for Climate Education: Scaffolding Data and Texts in the ClassroomTeachers are under pressure to teach a certain curriculum and prepare for certain exams. This limits curricular flexibility and time. We'll provide accessible entryways to teach climate education using data and texts. Strategies and resources available for grade levels K-12.

Curated by Amanda + James in partnership with Asia Stewart, The third iteration of Summer happenings is centered on the theme of coastlines.Too often, many of us rush through New York City and forget that we live on a series of islands whose natural landscape has been adapted and shaped by generations of forgotten inhabitants.  We neglect our land’s past: the violence that resides in soil stolen from the Lenape people (including the Wappinger, Munsee Lenape, Schaghticoke, Canarsie, Matinecock, and Lekawe nations). We look past the waterways’ paths; many brush up against terminals, docks, and piers and have been constructed for and destroyed by cycles of trade, capital, and exchange. As coastal living becomes increasingly precarious with climate change, we hope you will consider the history, value, beauty, and fragility of our brackish borders. Our presence here is not neutral."

Would you stop wearing your favorite color if you disagreed with the methods by which it was made? Are the colors and materials we use to depict the future in science fiction storytelling possible, given what we now know about their environmental impact? In this workshop, participants will dive into the exciting world of bacterial pigments and explore their integration into artwork through the dynamic techniques of block printing and silk screen printing. While thinking critically about their real world applications. We will cover the basics of how to select, grow and maintain the bacteria as your medium - and the challenges to the durability and life cycle of bacterially pigmented items.Hands-on sessions will be contextualized within a framework that maps the industrial and cultural histories of color and textile dyeing alongside current speculative and realworld trends in the production and utilization of biopigments.We will consider the science and sociopolitical forces driving industry at critical junctures leading to our current anti-fast-fashion climate. Our intention is to come away with an action each of us can do on our own, and that one person we know will adopt that brings us a little closer to a better fashion future.

"Beyond Federally-Funded Buyouts – Local Policies, Tools and Funding",This virtual panel explores innovative approaches and tools for local governments and communities to overcome equity and implementation challenges associated with federal disaster resources.,6/14/23 12:00,6/14/23 13:30,Online Event,Online,https://www.climate.columbia.edu/events/beyond-federally-funded-buyouts-local-policies-tools-and-funding,/Users/raiidahmed/Desktop/climate_tech_columbia_climate_nyc.csv,,"Beyond Federally-Funded Buyouts – Local Policies, Tools and Funding Streams
While federal resources are critical for providing relocation support to thousands of people living in the U.S., national policies and programs are falling short in addressing the urgency, scale, and complexity of climate-driven displacement. When it comes to buyouts and property acquisitions, accessing federal funds poses significant challenges. Restrictive requirements and lengthy bureaucratic processes can hinder local governments from developing compassionate and locally-responsive programs that prioritize community needs. To overcome these hurdles, local governments can leverage local funding sources to reduce their reliance on federal disaster dollars. By diversifying funding sources, local governments can not only expand relocation assistance beyond individual home buyouts, but also align their programs with local values and broader resilience goals.
Join us for an engaging conversation as we explore innovative approaches and tools for local governments and communities to overcome equity and implementation challenges associated with federal disaster resources. In this webinar, moderated by Urban Ocean Lab (UOL), our panel of experts, including representatives from local governments and nonprofits, will share valuable insights from their experiences on leveraging local funding sources for more just and holistic approaches to climate-driven relocation.
This virtual panel is presented by Urban Ocean Lab, in partnership with Columbia University's Climate School as part of the 2023 conference At What Point Managed Retreat?: Habitability and Mobility in an Era of Climate Change

            Climate LIVE K12: Harnessing the Power of Communities to Fight Flooding and Protect Our Waterways 
Climate LIVE K12 (formerly EI LIVE K12) is dedicated to bringing the science of sustainability to K12 students, educators, and parents.
About this Event 
Presenter:  Paul Gallay, Senior Staff Associate and Resilient Coastal Communities Project Leader, Center for Sustainable Urban Development 
Target Audience: Grades 9-12, Undergraduate, Educators, and the Public 
Climate-driven flooding is worsening due to sea level rise and rapidly intensifying storms, with many of the most serious impacts being felt in disadvantaged communities already reeling from decades of underinvestment in water quality and ecosystem health. To protect our most vulnerable communities, government planners must find new ways to respect and center the wisdom that only those communities possess. Can we build the just and equitable partnerships we'll need to survive climate change?
A link to join the session will be provided to all registered participants 24 hours in advance.

Our goal is clear: together, we need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and stop burning fossil fuels. And we need to do this in a way that is equitable and just. Any one of the thousands of jobs that help with that is a climate career! You could focus on reducing GHG emissions in buildings - working in designing, construction, or clean energy. Or you could manage green space, by working in natural areas or agriculture. You might help us move toward “circularity” - reducing waste through repairing goods or reusing materials. Or you may help your community be more resilient. This means reducing peoples’ vulnerability to climate hazards.  Maybe you want to be an educator and teach people about climate change, or you love economics and want to help finance solutions. Maybe you’ll invent a solution no one knows about yet!  Whatever your interests, there is a climate career path for you. Participating Organizations We'll have representatives from over 20 different organizations, all focused on environment, climate, or green industries. Come learn about the different opportunities available in the NYC area and speak to workers who are taking climate action in their jobs!Student-Led WorkshopsW﻿e have optional, student-led workshops:Climate Communications in Your School Upcycling Workshop W﻿e'll also have a keynote speaker to talk about being a young climate professional, and activities like an eco-book swap!

"Billy Fleming, “Fire, Ice, and Ore”","Arctic Elements, Indigenous Resistance, and the Global Energy Transition",6/22/23 19:00,6/22/23 21:00,"172 Classon Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11205",NYC,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/billy-fleming-fire-ice-and-ore-tickets-634990422447,/Users/raiidahmed/Desktop/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_nyc.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/e-flux-screening-room-21852381346,"e-flux Architecure presents “Fire, Ice, and Ore: Arctic Elements, Indigenous Resistance, and the Global Energy Transition,” a lecture by Billy Fleming at e-flux on Thursday, June 22 at 7pm.The struggle for climate justice is a generational project. Though it is often framed in abstract terms—warming scenarios, emissions pathways, integrated assessment models for damages, and fuel mixes in the grid—it is rarely experienced this way. Rather, the global energy transition and the broader struggle for climate justice are often understood—and thus won or lost—in materialist terms: through investments in the buildings, landscapes, public works, and built environment that stitch together everyday life for most people. This is the proposition at the core of Green New Dealers’ program—to transform how and where we live and relate to one other by tackling carbon emissions and inequality at once. But these forces extend well beyond the boundaries of a parcel of building envelope where designers typically engage with questions of climate action. The technologies at the core of the energy transition—solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, battery farms, data centers, and advanced nuclear power—all depend on a planetary supply matrix of rare earth elements and critical minerals. These pockets of exceedingly valuable ore tend to be developed in the Global South—and especially in the most remote locations of the Global South, where rules, laws, and norms can be suspended or ignored by multinational mining companies without the scrutiny of local or international press. The poles of this process—the mines and the end-use technological deployments—are linked through a network of waste disposal sites, manufacturing hubs, renewable energy deployment zones, and the various labor and logistical forces that make them all possible.  One of those poles rests in South Greenland’s Kvanefjeld Mine—an erstwhile uranium mine that was key to the Allies’ postwar nuclear energy and weapons programs, that was subsequently decommissioned after decades of anti-mining militancy by a local group of Inuit activists known as Urani? Naamik! (Uranium? No thanks!). But prospectors have since discovered that the mine is home to the world’s second-densest deposit of rare earth elements and critical minerals that, coupled with Greenland’s postcolonial relationship with Denmark, and the region has entered a state of suspended reality as interested parties wait for the Danish court system to rule on exploitation licenses for the site. This lecture will situate Greenland within the global energy transition and implicate its future in that of the Global North. Put another way, this lecture will ask what it means for resource communities like Narsaq, Greenland for the U.S. and other imperial powers to pursue the kind of resource-intensive energy transition that is now underway. “Fire, Ice, and Ore” is presented as part of e-flux Architecture Lectures, a monthly series inviting researchers and practitioners to discuss timely issues in contemporary architecture, theory, culture, and technology.Billy Fleming is the founding Wilks Family Director of the Ian L. McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design. He is a co-founder of the Climate + Community Project—a climate justice think tank dedicated to connecting movement demands and progressive legislators through applied research—and co-creator of the organization Data Refuge—an international initiative to secure critical environmental data at risk of erasure during the Trump Administration. His work includes the recent books A Blueprint for Coastal Adaptation with Carolyn Kousky and Alan Berger, and Design With Nature Now with Frederick Steiner, Richard Weller, and Karen M’Closkey. Billy’s writing and scholarship have appeared in Dissent, The Guardian, Washington Post, New York Times, Places Journal, and Journal of Architectural Education, among others. His current book project is titled Building Just, Post-Carbon Futures: Imagining and Implementing Climate Justice in America and is expected in 2024.For more information, contact program@e-flux.com.Accessibility					 –Two flights of stairs lead up to the building’s front entrance at 172 Classon Avenue.		  –For elevator access, please RSVP to program@e-flux.com.

Quantifying ESG Risk,This in-person conversation will provide valuable insights into the rapidly growing field of ESG Risk and its impact on the emerging world.,6/1/23 17:15,6/1/23 19:45,"New York City Bar Association, 42 West 44th Street New York, NY 10036",NYC,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/quantifying-esg-risk-tickets-630970659227,/Users/raiidahmed/Desktop/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_nyc.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/prmia-61381240913,"The world has come to recognize the impact of ESG issues on an entity’s financial health and viability. As ESG issues become increasingly pertinent to both the developed and the emerging world, there is a greater need to quantity risk(s) emanating from company operations and developing tools to measure and manage ESG risks. Since the materiality of ESG issues differs by industry, a common quantification system to compare entity performance on ESG parameters is the need of the hour. This is important to have cross-entity evaluation as well. Quantifying ESG risk involves understanding relevant ESG factors for an entity, understanding each factor’s importance for the entity, assigning weights based on the importance, and then scoring an entity’s initiatives and measures to mitigate the ESG risk. The approach to quantify ESG risk works like a common currency to compare entities on a uniform scale and provide a quick idea about their management of ESG issues.

In conversation with Christina Brophy.P﻿LEASE NOTE: This free event is first come, first served; RSVPs are encouraged. Seating is limited. Doors open at 5:30 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.Fueled by an abiding concern with environmental crisis for more than three decades, contemporary artist Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) depicts an ominous and complex vision of ocean life affected by humankind in a monumental new series titled Oceanus. Alexis Rockman: Oceanus takes the viewer on a global journey of discovery beneath the world's changing seas, through the artist's ethereal and sublime renderings of real and imaginary marine life within a fragile ecosystem. Published to accompany an ambitious traveling exhibition in North America and abroad, this volume documents Rockman's newly executed 8 x 24-foot panoramic painting Oceanus and ten related large watercolors, important works that tell the story of humanity's indelible relationship with the ocean and the connections between the sea and our own survival, as the artist deftly weaves natural history, art history, archaeology, adventure, political analysis, and science into a story about the human condition. Complementing this stunning presentation of Rockman's paintings--as well as many details and photographs documenting the artist's process, along with a rich selection of contextual imagery--are essays by leading writers and scholars on such topics as maritime and oceanic history and Rockman's work within the larger context of art history.
Alexis Rockman is a contemporary American painter known for his fantastical paintings of dystopian natural environments. Rockman tackles ecological issues—such as climate change and species extinction—through his large-scale artworks. Part-artist, part-activist, he confronts pressing social issues head on through carefully rendered paintings of animals and their rapidly changing environments.Christina Brophy is Senior Director of Museum Galleries and Senior Vice President of Curatorial Affairs at the Mystic Seaport Museum."
Lalela Ulwandle: Listen to the Sea, A gripping theatre production from South Africa which explores the many ways in which people are connected to the ocean.,6/12/23 19:00,6/12/23 21:00," 176 Saint Nicholas Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11237",NYC,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lalela-ulwandle-listen-to-the-sea-tickets-640416953347,/Users/raiidahmed/Desktop/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_nyc.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/empatheatre-65335568793,"Lalela uLwandle is a research-based theatre project that makes visible stories of living with the ocean that are seldom seen or heard in the public domain. Lalela uLwandle means “Listen to the Sea” in isiZulu. At some point in our lives, many of us have picked up a large shell and placed it against our ears to hear the sound of the oceans within it. It is this image that we invoke in this project, of standing quietly on the beach and listening to the stories of the ocean, and the people who have an intimate relationship with it. Weaving the stories, histories and contemporary concerns of diverse South African coastal communities into an Empatheatre production, Lalela uLwandle explores themes of intergenerational environmental injustices, tangible and intangible ocean heritage, marine science and the myriad threats to ocean health.The performance sheds new light and hope on some of the well-known conundrums of ocean governance. Most noticeably it has surfaced intangible heritages of the ocean, and challenged evidence hierarchies in local law and international policy. Recently the audio play of Lalela uLwandle was used as evidence (along with two other short films from Empatheatre) in three court proceedings in legal cases against Oil and Gas giant Shell and the South African government in 2022. The play, was used as evidence to support the rich and powerful affidavits of small scale fishers and other ocean defenders in the case. This was the first time in SA history, that art was used as evidence in ocean governance, and found ways to represent indigenous intangible heritage in meaningful and inclusive ways. One of the most significant aspects of the play illustrates how natural and social scientists can collaborate with holders of different knowledge systems, respectfully and constructively, to develop a more integrated understanding of environmental challenges. The play also illuminates the close connections between human rights and ocean-climate governance, from the local to the international level. There will be a discussion with the audience after the performance, in which we look forward to engaging with different policy makers and publics, experts and stakeholders. During these discussions, we think critically about the importance of listening to and mutual learning among researchers, spiritual healers, small-scale fishers and other stakeholders, and how this can transform the way we understand unexplored connections to the ocean and its role in climate governance.  Lalela uLwandle is an invitation to a participatory public conversation on ocean governance in South Africa. It is funded under the One Ocean Hub, a five-country hub of researchers exploring more democratic methods of engagement in ocean governance.

Brown) are lifelong best friends, brothers from another mother– and the last two men on earth. Their survival is largely due to Ray, a brilliant scientist who designed a domed structure with all the systems necessary to sustain life on a planet that could no longer support it. Their custom biosphere is outfitted with basic necessities and creature comforts that make it possible to retain a sense of what life used to be like. A hydroponic garden provides fresh vegetables and a carefully managed fishpond supplies essential protein. Recently, however, fish have begun dying at an alarming rate. With a mere three fish remaining, Billy and Ray face an ominous future. But life may yet find a way.,Dr. Marcy Later has devoted her life to nuclear fusion, a long-proposed but never realized renewable energy solution for climate change. At a scientific conference in New Orleans with her two young children, she neglects her maternal and professional responsibilities by hanging out with a group of Furries, who are attending their own conference at the same hotel -- all while a major hurricane gathers strength offshore.Courtesy of IFC Films and AMC Networks.
