In conversation with Christina Brophy.P﻿LEASE NOTE: This free event is first come, first served; RSVPs are encouraged. Seating is limited. Doors open at 5:30 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.Fueled by an abiding concern with environmental crisis for more than three decades, contemporary artist Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) depicts an ominous and complex vision of ocean life affected by humankind in a monumental new series titled Oceanus. Alexis Rockman: Oceanus takes the viewer on a global journey of discovery beneath the world's changing seas, through the artist's ethereal and sublime renderings of real and imaginary marine life within a fragile ecosystem. Published to accompany an ambitious traveling exhibition in North America and abroad, this volume documents Rockman's newly executed 8 x 24-foot panoramic painting Oceanus and ten related large watercolors, important works that tell the story of humanity's indelible relationship with the ocean and the connections between the sea and our own survival, as the artist deftly weaves natural history, art history, archaeology, adventure, political analysis, and science into a story about the human condition. Complementing this stunning presentation of Rockman's paintings--as well as many details and photographs documenting the artist's process, along with a rich selection of contextual imagery--are essays by leading writers and scholars on such topics as maritime and oceanic history and Rockman's work within the larger context of art history.
Alexis Rockman is a contemporary American painter known for his fantastical paintings of dystopian natural environments. Rockman tackles ecological issues—such as climate change and species extinction—through his large-scale artworks. Part-artist, part-activist, he confronts pressing social issues head on through carefully rendered paintings of animals and their rapidly changing environments.Christina Brophy is Senior Director of Museum Galleries and Senior Vice President of Curatorial Affairs at the Mystic Seaport Museum."
