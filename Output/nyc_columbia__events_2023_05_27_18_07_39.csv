            Climate LIVE K12: Harnessing the Power of Communities to Fight Flooding and Protect Our Waterways 
Climate LIVE K12 (formerly EI LIVE K12) is dedicated to bringing the science of sustainability to K12 students, educators, and parents.
About this Event 
Presenter:  Paul Gallay, Senior Staff Associate and Resilient Coastal Communities Project Leader, Center for Sustainable Urban Development 
Target Audience: Grades 9-12, Undergraduate, Educators, and the Public 
Climate-driven flooding is worsening due to sea level rise and rapidly intensifying storms, with many of the most serious impacts being felt in disadvantaged communities already reeling from decades of underinvestment in water quality and ecosystem health. To protect our most vulnerable communities, government planners must find new ways to respect and center the wisdom that only those communities possess. Can we build the just and equitable partnerships we'll need to survive climate change?
A link to join the session will be provided to all registered participants 24 hours in advance.

"Beyond Federally-Funded Buyouts – Local Policies, Tools and Funding",Join us for an engaging conversation as we explore innovative approaches and tools for local governments and communities to overcome equity and implementation challenges associated with federal disaster resources.,2023-06-14 12:00,2023-06-14 13:30,Online Event,,FALSE.,https://www.climate.columbia.edu/events/beyond-federally-funded-buyouts-local-policies-tools-and-funding,,,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/CTC-Scraper-GPT-Live/columbia_climate.csv,"Beyond Federally-Funded Buyouts – Local Policies, Tools and Funding Streams
While federal resources are critical for providing relocation support to thousands of people living in the U.S., national policies and programs are falling short in addressing the urgency, scale, and complexity of climate-driven displacement. When it comes to buyouts and property acquisitions, accessing federal funds poses significant challenges. Restrictive requirements and lengthy bureaucratic processes can hinder local governments from developing compassionate and locally-responsive programs that prioritize community needs. To overcome these hurdles, local governments can leverage local funding sources to reduce their reliance on federal disaster dollars. By diversifying funding sources, local governments can not only expand relocation assistance beyond individual home buyouts, but also align their programs with local values and broader resilience goals.
Join us for an engaging conversation as we explore innovative approaches and tools for local governments and communities to overcome equity and implementation challenges associated with federal disaster resources. In this webinar, moderated by Urban Ocean Lab (UOL), our panel of experts, including representatives from local governments and nonprofits, will share valuable insights from their experiences on leveraging local funding sources for more just and holistic approaches to climate-driven relocation.
This virtual panel is presented by Urban Ocean Lab, in partnership with Columbia University's Climate School as part of the 2023 conference At What Point Managed Retreat?: Habitability and Mobility in an Era of Climate Change
Moderator: Erica Asinas, Policy Advisor at Urban Ocean Lab

Brendan Shane, Climate Director at Trust for Public Land
Louise Yeung, Chief Climate Officer at the New York City Comptroller Office
Johanna Lovecchio, Associate Director of the Center for Resilient Cities and Landscapes at Columbia University
Tim Trautman, Flood Mitigation Program Manager at Charlotte-Mecklenburg County

As the world transitions from consuming fossil fuels-based energy into low-carbon energy sources, demand for copper, lithium, nickel, and other minerals will increase for things like electric mobility, solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage. However, the world is not on track to get these minerals at current rates. The world’s demand for lithium is projected to increase by 40 times and that for copper to potentially double by 2040 relative to 2020 levels. 
Latin America has the world’s largest deposits of both copper and lithium. Chile and Peru are the world’s leading copper producers with about 40% of global production, while Chile and Argentina account for 32% of global lithium supply. However, Latin America faces a number of social, political, environmental, and financial challenges to increase its critical minerals extraction and processing capacity. 
The Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs will host a panel of experts to discuss what needs to be done to accelerate sustainable copper and lithium extraction in Latin American countries. This event will focus on the challenges and opportunities that governments and industry face to turn these mineral reserves into a bridge for the energy transition globally. Light refreshments will be provided.
Panelists:
María José Baptista, Interagency and Intergovernmental Affairs Officer, United Nations Environment Programme
Juan Carlos Jobet, Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy  at Columbia University SIPA; Dean, School of Business, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez; Former Minister of Energy and Mining, Chile
Tom Moerenhout, Research Scholar, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA; Adjunct Associate Professor of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University SIPA; Adjunct Assistant Professor, New York University Stern School of Business; Senior Advisor, World Bank
