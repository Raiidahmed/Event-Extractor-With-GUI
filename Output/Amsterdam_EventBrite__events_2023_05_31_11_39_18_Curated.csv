E﻿XPERTS & MENTORS (More to be announced)Dr. Troy NachtigallDr Troy Nachtigall is a Designer and Design Researcher exploring the data-material relationship through Fashion and Design.  As a Professor at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and researcher at TU/e, Troy leads research into personalized computational fabrication of clothing, shoes, and accessories. For the Design for Change retreat, Troy will introduce the concept of Systems Thinking and guide participants actively into this way of thinking by collectively playing a designerly game called ‘Loopholes’. The Loopholes game has been collaboratively developed by Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, New Order of Fashion, Elisava University School of Design and Engineering of Barcelona, and other European knowledge partners of the EU Transitions project,.Evey Kwong [futurprimitiv]Evey Kwong is a designer and researcher whose practice evolves in the theme of craft-based technology by connecting with the origin of material cultures, people and place.Her works have been exhibited at the Museum of European Cultures [DE], HOW&WOW BASK IT! [Dutch Design Week] and U-JOINTS: Knots & Knits [Fiskars Biennale, FI]. fueled by her desire to promote crafts making, she collaborates with various institutions on design research projects and workshops. For the Design for Change Retreat, Evey will lead the workshop ‘Connecting Twines’. The earliest twine was made by twisting, untwisting and braiding lengths of plant fiber. Twine is most commonly used in textiles and basketry. The invention of twine is at least as important as the development of stone tools for early humans. Archaeologists have called the development of twine, which can be made stronger and longer than its component fibers, “the string revolution”.Pollyanna MossPollyanna Moss engages in local practices of crafts and explores their inherent narratives. Her work materialises subjective and complex relationships between humans and the environment through design pieces and video installations, which together provide a careful reading of the landscapes she investigates. Through her design practice, Pollyanna develops strong working relationships with multiple parties - co-ordinating and communicating through shared care for the environment, and the species that inhabit various local domains. For the Design for Change Retreat, Pollyanna will be taking participants to the sheep stall in Heeze, near Eindhoven, for an afternoon of grounding and embodied learning experiences about  the local endemic Kempisch Heideschaap. You will see and feel the landscape the sheep regeneratively graze, hear from a local shepherd and work with the precious wool collectively.PRACTICALThe Design for Change Retreat offers a limited number of seats to ensure an intensive, safe and intimate learning environment, where exchange, fee sharing of ideas and open discussion are at the heart of the learning experience.

To achieve the Dutch policy objective to reduce carbon emissions by 55% in 2030, a shift from fossil towards renewable energy resources is required. Within the Netherlands, geothermal energy is a proven renewable energy resource, but currently only with a limited number of operating installations. Presently producing geothermal projects in the Netherlands are generally located in areas where abundant subsurface data is available.A limiting factor to the broader development of geothermal projects is the fact that the subsurface data in the Netherlands is not well distributed; seismic & well data coverage is poor in roughly half of the country, including major residential and industrial areas with high heat demand. Improving the data coverage in these areas would increase the benefit-risk ratio of geothermal projects. 
In 2017 a framework study was carried out by Energie Beheer Nederland B.V. (EBN) and the TNO Advisory Group for Economic Affairs (TNO-AGE) to identify what data acquisition is required to overcome this data limitation.Subsequently, EBN and TNO-AGE have embarked on a geothermal exploration program (SCAN: ‘Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland’) to acquire additional subsurface data to decrease subsurface uncertainty and hence shape the conditions needed to encourage the development of geothermal projects. This program is government funded through the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate.
The SCAN program is focused on three key activities, namely:
1. The acquisition of regional 2D seismic data
2. The reprocessing of existing 2D seismic data
3. A data well campaign
The acquisition of the new seismic data started with a 2D test line in early 2019, which was carefully analysed to determine the optimum and affordable 2D acquisition parameter for the regional acquisition. The resulting key acquisition parameters were a shot spacing of 60m and a geophone spacing of 5m, using explosives as seismic source. In September 2019 the regional acquisition campaign started and lasted for almost 2.5 years, acquiring a total of 1800 km of 2D seismic and a total of almost 7500 km vintage seismic data is processed. All resulting data is made public free of charge on the SCAN website and the Dutch subsurface portal (NLOG). Based on this newly acquired data, ten search areas have been selected and the first SCAN well is planned to be drilled in 2023.A﻿bout JoahnnesMy name is Johannes van den Akker, I’m 30 years old and live in Amsterdam. I finished the Idea League Geophysics Master in 2018 and after graduating I was not really looking for an office job. I guess I got lucky and I started working for EBN B.V. in 2019 as an acquisition geophysicist. Since then I have been involved in the Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland (SCAN) project, mainly in the field for the acquisition of 2D seismic data. Recently I’ve been working on well development and data acquisition planning for the coming SCAN wells."
No More Building as Usual: Architecture Beyond Carbon and Greed,A gathering to explore the new roles that architects and urban designers can take up around socio-ecological ambitions,6/24/23 10:00,6/24/23 17:30,Rotterdamse Academie van Bouwkunst,Rotterdam,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-no-more-building-as-usual-architecture-beyond-carbon-and-greed-636462876597,https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/rotterdamse-academie-van-bouwkunst-11846198964,"[﻿Nederlands hieronder]The built environment is one of the largest drivers of natural resource depletion, ecosystem destruction, rising temperatures and more extreme weather conditions, and increasing socioeconomic inequality. Designers and other actors in the production of space play an important role in this and are responsible for developing alternative building practices that help counter these negative trends.On Saturday June 24 we organise a gathering to discuss new roles that architects and urban designers can take up. How can we give shape to a different planning, design culture and construction industry? How can we learn to have positive footprints before a carbon lockdown goes into effect? What does it mean to approach the (built) environment from a perspective of regeneration? What type of architects do we want to be? And how can we do so in a healthy work culture? We want to explore a way of working that goes beyond the competitive model of individual success and soloist genius, towards one of collaboration around socio-ecological ambitions.This work conference marks the end of the 5-year term of Renske van der Stoep and Thijs van Spaandonk as heads of the Masters in Architecture and Urbanism and a celebration of the education programme they introduced, “Design for the Rotterdam Climate Reality”.

Ontwerpers en andere actoren in de productie van de gebouwde omgeving spelen hierin een belangrijke rol en zijn mede verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen van een alternatieve bouwpraktijk die de negatieve tendensen weet om te buigen.Op zaterdag 24 juni gaan we in gesprek over nieuwe rollen die architecten en stedenbouwkundigen kunnen en moeten oppakken. Hoe kunnen we werken aan een andere planologie, ontwerpcultuur en bouwpraktijk? Hoe kunnen we bijvoorbeeld gebouwen een positieve footprint geven en voorkomen dat we in een totale CO2-lockdown terechtkomen? Hoe kunnen we de gebouwde omgeving ontwikkelen op basis van regeneratieve uitgangspunten? Wat voor ontwerpers willen we zijn? En hoe kunnen we een gezonde werkcultuur ontwikkelen? We streven naar een werkwijze die het competitieve model van individueel succes en het solistische genie achterlaat en samenwerking rond sociaal-ecologische ambities centraal stelt.Deze werkconferentie markeert de afsluiting van de vijfjarige termijn van Renske van der Stoep en Thijs van Spaandonk als hoofden van de masteropleidingen Architectuur en Stedenbouw en een viering van het onderwijsprogramma ‘Ontwerpen aan de Rotterdamse Klimaatopgaven’, waartoe zij de aanzet hebben gegeven.

The prevention of institutional racism and discrimination in AI systems requires grasping two highly significant but often ignored aspects. The relation between inclusion and technology. The world of diversity and inclusion rarely meets the world of digitalization and automation, while the two are often heavily intertwined.The nascent study of coloniality in this meeting of worlds. In this masterclass we will go beyond the ethical perspective that often overlooks these two aspects and provide an understanding of how colonial histories play a role in AI today.About the speaker Oumaima Hajri, Researcher/Lecturer Responsible Applied AI, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.Oumaima Hajri is a researcher at Kenniscentrum Creating 010.

But there are many more ways in which one can have a positive impact on society, for instance through social movement, activism and good old-fashioned charity.Charity knows many forms and flavours, and has itself been the topic of much debate and research. How do you achieve the best outcome? Do you trust large organisations to decide how to effectively spend your money, or do you simply hand out cash to individuals and let them spend it where they feel it is most needed?And who decides what the 'best outcome' is? The greatest good for the greatest number of people sounds like a sensible approach for impact on society. But do the needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few, or are there other values and human rights at stake?Kritika Maheshwari is Assistant Professor in Ethics & Philosophy of Technology at the TPM Faculty of TU Delft.

More than 220 million students study at some 23,000 higher education institutions worldwide. Universities are the single most important source of basic research worldwide, while at the same time educating millions for increasingly knowledge-based economies. The higher education enterprise has undergone dramatic and unprecedented change in the past 70 years—going from a relatively small elite sector to educating more than 70 percent of young people in wealthy countries and a third or more in most of the rest of the world. Massification has been the hallmark of higher education worldwide. At the same time, the global knowledge economy depends on universities for research, communication, and education. Higher education has also become more international.Recently, geopolitical tensions, health pandemics and climate change challenge higher education worldwide. In this seminar, we will address the development of international(-ization of) higher education and the implications of geopolitical tensions.  Professor Dr. Philip G.

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals. The School of Life’s drive to spread greater self-awareness and The Humblebrag’s action-oriented courses make for a perfect combination to support the next generations of agenda-setting change-makers. We hope that participants will not only become aware of their own purpose and values but will also be able to put them into action through storytelling and taking a stand on important social and climate issues.Practical informationDuration and location: 2 days on location in the center of Amsterdam, including coffee, tea and a delicious organic, vegetarian lunch.  Number of participants: max 25 persons  Price: € 825 excluding VATLanguage: English Accessibility: at location Frederiksplein, easy to reach by public transport.  Study load: there is no compulsory homework.

Action training People vs Polluters: Tata Steel,A mass action training (NVDA) to prepare for a mass action at Tata Steel organized by Greenpeace,6/18/23 13:00,6/18/23 17:00,"De Pletterij, 122 Lange Herenvest, 2011 BX Haarlem, Netherlands",Haarlem,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tickets-action-training-people-vs-polluters-tata-steel-haarlem-608720809327,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/greenpeace-nl-29429960681,"[Nederlandse tekst hieronder]Have no or little experience in taking action yet? No problem! For you, we organize an action training. A fun and educational afternoon with others who also want to take action for the climate. During the training you will find out whether you want to join the action at Tata Steel. And if you do, you will be well prepared! We advise everyone to take a training if you are participating in an action for the first time.The training is suitable for different experience levels. Participants with more experience are welcome to share their experiences, make new contacts and refresh their skills. So if you want to join the action at Tata Steel, consider attending a training - not only for yourself, but also for your fellow activists! During the training, we will prepare ourselves to stay safe during the action, but also to act effectively and efficiently. Special attention will be paid to explaining safety risks, legal information, forming and working with ""affinity groups"" and practicing specific action tactics.The training starts at 13:00 and ends at 17:00 (walk-in from 12:45). We have a full program so come on time! It is very important to register for the training in time: if there are too few registrations, the training cannot take place. There is a maximum number of participants, if you want to be sure of a place, register as soon as possible!The main language in this training is English. If a language barrier prevents you from participating, we can find a solution such as whisper translation into Dutch to make participation possible. If only Dutch speakers are present, the trainer team may decide, in consultation with the participants, to conduct the training in Dutch.[Nederlands]Heb je nog geen of weinig ervaring met actievoeren? Geen probleem! Voor jou organiseren we een actietraining. Een leuke en leerzame middag met anderen die ook in actie willen komen voor het klimaat. In de training merk je vanzelf of je aan de actie bij Tata Steel  mee wilt doen. En als je dat wilt, ben je meteen goed voorbereid! We raden iedereen aan om een training te volgen als je voor het eerst meedoet aan een actie.De training is geschikt voor verschillende ervaringsniveaus. Deelnemers met meer ervaring zijn van harte welkom om hun ervaringen te delen, nieuwe contacten te leggen en hun vaardigheden op te frissen. Dus als je mee wilt doen aan de actie bij Tata Steel, overweeg dan om een training te volgen - niet alleen voor jezelf, maar ook voor je mede-activisten! Tijdens de training zullen we ons voorbereiden om veilig te blijven tijdens de actie, maar ook om effectief en efficiënt te handelen. Speciale aandacht zal worden besteed aan het uitleggen van veiligheidsrisico's, juridische informatie, het vormen van en werken met ""affiniteitsgroepen"" en het oefenen van specifieke actietactieken.De training begint om 13:00 uur en eindigt om 17:00 uur (inloop vanaf 12:45). We hebben een vol programma dus kom op tijd! Het is erg belangrijk om je op tijd in te schrijven voor de training: als er te weinig inschrijvingen zijn kan de training niet doorgaan. Er is een maximum aantal deelnemers,  als je zeker wilt zijn van een plaats, schrijf je dan zo snel mogelijk in!D﻿e voertaal in deze training is Engels. Als een taalbarriere je tegen houdt om mee te doen kunnen we een oplossing zoeken zoals fluistervertaling naar het Nederlands om deelneming toch mogelijk te maken. Mochten er  enkel nederlandssprekende personen aanwezig zijn, dan kan het zijn dat het trainersteam besluit de training in overleg met de aanwezigen in het Nederlands te doen."
Regulating Risks in the Energy Transition — Dealing with Uncertainty,A high-level conference on how governments should address questions of uncertainty when regulating risks in the energy transition.,7/5/23 9:00,7/5/23 17:00,"Amare - Den Haag, 150 Spuiplein 2511 DG Den Haag Netherlands",The Hague,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/regulating-risks-in-the-energy-transition-dealing-with-uncertainty-tickets-623719731507,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/oecd-and-netherlands-ministry-of-economic-affairs-and-climate-policy-64891441513,"The Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are organising a conference on the role of the precautionary principle in the energy transition and on regulating the risks of hydrogen. The day will be opened by the Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy Policy, Rob Jetten, and other speakers include high-level officials of the OECD and the European Commission. There will also be talks and workshops from senior representatives from government and academia. This event marks the conclusion of the EC DG REFORM funded TSI project “Precaution in the Energy Transition and Improved Knowledge for Hydrogen Risk Regulation.” The conference will take place in The Hague on the 5th of July 2023 in the brand-new Amare building and aims at presenting and disseminating main findings and recommendations of the OECD Project. The theme deals with important questions for the success of the energy transition. To successfully carry out the energy transition, inevitable risks that come with it need to be appropriately regulated. How should governments deal with questions of uncertainty, risk and precaution in regulating new energy technologies? This is the main question that will be addressed.  The day will also include practical discussions. For example, how to use recent tools and guidelines and the perspective of local administrators. The morning will be devoted to presentations and a panel discussion which focus on uncertainty in the energy transition with an emphasis on hydrogen risk regulation throughout. The afternoon will be filled with workshops on the following topics: hydrogen risk, precaution and uncertainty, tools for local political governance, risk policy principles, and learning from incidents. Each workshop will be given twice to give participants the opportunity to attend multiple.If you are interested to attend this event, please register for a free ticket on this page.There will be five workshops in the afternoon to go deeper into the issues. Each will be given twice, so you have the opportunity to attend two of them. In the registration form, please inform us of all the workshops you would like to attend, we will allocate them accordingly.Here is a short introduction to the workshops to help you select the ones that interest you most. Learning from IncidentsTransitions, such as the energy transition, require good legislation. Make laws and rules for the long term. Make room for learning, evaluation and experimentation. Dare to question existing systems. In this way, there is more room during implementation to respond quickly to all the new and uncertain aspects that occur in transitions.At the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, the Dutch Council for Public Administration issued an advisory paper on learning in transitions. The advice addresses the question of how learning in transitions is possible, without immediately wanting to cover every risk with new laws and regulations.The Council advises on the basis of principles of good public administration: the rule of law, democracy and administrative capacity. In transitions, things happen unintentionally, so it is necessary to create space for learning, and that sets requirements on public administration. Such as room to make mistakes and learn by trial and error: in other words to stumble and fall, get up again and keep on going.Moderator: Peter Verheij (member Dutch Council for Public Administration)Dutch Risk Policy Principles for the Energy TransitionThe energy transition needs urgent action, but our present system of regulating risk in the Netherlands is not always adequately suited to its innovative character.The Dutch Cabinet will in 2023 present a set of policy principles to deal responsibly with safety and health risks and accelerate the energy transition equally. These principles combine a continuation of good old practices (such as risk and knowledge based approach) with constructive and sound earlier advises, which have not been implemented yet. Additional new elements intend to make the risk approach more compatible with the innovative technologies that come with the energy transition.The risk policy principles, as well as the ideas and discussions surrounding them, will be explained by their developers from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management: Jan van Tol, Jos Benner and Rob Smal.Tools for Local Political governanceAny administrator or public representative who must make decisions about new projects for the energy transition will be familiar with this dilemma: the energy transition is necessary due to, among other things, the significant risk of climate change. But inevitably, as with any human activity, new technology will also introduce new risks. How do we decide what new risks are acceptable and which approach to the precautionary principle is suitable? A group of Dutch mayors, aldermen and provincial authorities, the working group for a safe energy transition (Bestuurlijk Overleg voor een Veilige Energietransitie in Nederland, BOVEN) believes that integral decision making is the way forward. This means taking both the positive and the negative risks of new technology into the equation. As an aid by that effort a new tool for local decision makers has been developed, the “risk mixing console”. This enables the comparison of existing and new safety and health risks using as common denominator the WHO disability adjusted life year (DALY).In this workshop the challenge for local authorities and the use of the risk mixing console will be discussed. Moderator: Ira Helsloot (professor Governance of Safety and Security, Radboud University)Hydrogen Risk RegulationThis work centres around dealing with risk uncertainty when adopting a new technology, hydrogen as a common based fuel and energy source, where there is an absence of agreed and shared understanding of the hazards and risks – even when the benefits of this technology are accepted. In response to global energy pressures and the urgent need to tackle climate many governments have set out ambitious energy transition policies and plans but delivering these changes into local communities has become a challenge in the light of uncertainty about the risks. The workshop will explore the dynamics of risk based regulation and societal acceptance of these new technologies.Moderator: Ian TraversUncertainty and Precaution in the Energy TransitionInformation to follow, check back soon."

The film shows the struggle of Kiribati’s president, Ton, against the backdrop of UN climate negotiations in Paris. This is dramatically strung through a telling of the personal story of Tiemeri, a mother of six who is trying everything she can to ensure that she and her family can move to safety in New Zealand.The film screening will be followed by a special Hague Talks and discussion where we will delve into the topic of ecocide, environmental justice, and how Mozambique and its Chief Justice is working to secure a more just future for its people.About the speakers: Jojo Mehta, a Co-Founder and Executive Director of Stop Ecocide International. Jojo has been at the forefront of the movement to establish ecocide as a crime at the International Criminal Court. Her extensive experience in coordinating legal developments, diplomatic traction, and public narrative, coupled with her clear and engaging communication style, make her an inspiring and knowledgeable speaker to address the pressing issue of environmental justice.Mert Kumru is an avid campaigner for World Youth for Climate Justice here in Europe. Now that climate justice is becoming a much more broadly accepted term, Mert offers us the opportunity to learn more about seeking justice for those affected by climate change.Ida Simonsen will moderate the event. Ida  is a farmer in training, agroecology activist, and Dutch UN Youth Representative on Biodiversity and Food. She is primarily active at the intersection of environmental justice, human rights and agrarian transformation with a focus on democratisation and youth participation. The event aligns with the overall theme of The Hague Justice Week 2023 , which is to promote and discuss justice and human rights on different scales. By focusing on environmental justice, the event highlights the critical role that the law plays in protecting the environment and ensuring that justice is served for both people and the planet."

It will take place 6-7 July 2023 in Amsterdam.  DescriptionThe VSR, the Dutch and Flemish Law and Society association, has existed since 1980 and is an association for researchers and practicing lawyers who themselves conduct research in the field of the empirical workings of law or are interested in it. During our annual two-day conference researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (sociologists of law, legal anthropologists, legal psychologists, public administration experts and criminologists) present their findings. See the VSR website for more details about its structure and goals.The theme for this year's Annual Conference is: The Next Generation.Society as a whole is faced with challenges on how to move further and how to ensure the next generation can thrive. Topics such as the climate crisis, migration, democratic backsliding, the role of technology are just a few of the pressing issues we are faced with. The Next Generation also means pushing boundaries, employing different approaches and creating space for junior academics and those voices in academia who do not always get the same space. All themes will be running throughout the whole conference. Our keynote speaker pushes boundaries with her approach to research, we want to connect scholars who have something to offer and those who seek help via Academic Speed Dating and create space for voices in academia who do not always get the same platform as others.There will be a conference fee to pay for food and drinks (tea and coffee, lunch and one reception with snacks included) during the conference. As a participant you can sign up for the conference dinner as well. The conference organizers will not provide or organise housing and accommodation, but we will provide some general information by email to registered participants.ProgramDuring these two days there will be four blocks with parallel sessions where papers will be presented. We are also very happy to announce our keynote speaker:Prof. Dr. Marie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard She conducts cutting-edge research in the area of criminology, AI and the use of CCTV (surveillance camera's) for observational research. Next to thought provoking and inspiring panel sessions, there will also be plenty of room to (re-)connect to fellow researchers during the coffee/tea and lunch breaks.We'll have drinks on Thursday the 6th of July on the Roeterseiland campus, followed by a 5-course walking dinner (drinks included) overlooking the beautiful city of Amsterdam.
