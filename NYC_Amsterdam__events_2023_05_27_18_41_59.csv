To achieve the Dutch policy objective to reduce carbon emissions by 55% in 2030, a shift from fossil towards renewable energy resources is required. Within the Netherlands, geothermal energy is a proven renewable energy resource, but currently only with a limited number of operating installations. Presently producing geothermal projects in the Netherlands are generally located in areas where abundant subsurface data is available.A limiting factor to the broader development of geothermal projects is the fact that the subsurface data in the Netherlands is not well distributed; seismic & well data coverage is poor in roughly half of the country, including major residential and industrial areas with high heat demand. Improving the data coverage in these areas would increase the benefit-risk ratio of geothermal projects. 
In 2017 a framework study was carried out by Energie Beheer Nederland B.V. (EBN) and the TNO Advisory Group for Economic Affairs (TNO-AGE) to identify what data acquisition is required to overcome this data limitation.Subsequently, EBN and TNO-AGE have embarked on a geothermal exploration program (SCAN: ‘Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland’) to acquire additional subsurface data to decrease subsurface uncertainty and hence shape the conditions needed to encourage the development of geothermal projects. This program is government funded through the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate.
The SCAN program is focused on three key activities, namely:
1. The acquisition of regional 2D seismic data
2. The reprocessing of existing 2D seismic data
3. A data well campaign
The acquisition of the new seismic data started with a 2D test line in early 2019, which was carefully analysed to determine the optimum and affordable 2D acquisition parameter for the regional acquisition. The resulting key acquisition parameters were a shot spacing of 60m and a geophone spacing of 5m, using explosives as seismic source. In September 2019 the regional acquisition campaign started and lasted for almost 2.5 years, acquiring a total of 1800 km of 2D seismic and a total of almost 7500 km vintage seismic data is processed. All resulting data is made public free of charge on the SCAN website and the Dutch subsurface portal (NLOG). Based on this newly acquired data, ten search areas have been selected and the first SCAN well is planned to be drilled in 2023.A﻿bout JoahnnesMy name is Johannes van den Akker, I’m 30 years old and live in Amsterdam. I finished the Idea League Geophysics Master in 2018 and after graduating I was not really looking for an office job. I guess I got lucky and I started working for EBN B.V. in 2019 as an acquisition geophysicist. Since then I have been involved in the Seismische Campagne Aardwarmte Nederland (SCAN) project, mainly in the field for the acquisition of 2D seismic data.

Designers and other actors in the production of space play an important role in this and are responsible for developing alternative building practices that help counter these negative trends.On Saturday June 24 we organise a gathering to discuss new roles that architects and urban designers can take up. How can we give shape to a different planning, design culture and construction industry? How can we learn to have positive footprints before a carbon lockdown goes into effect? What does it mean to approach the (built) environment from a perspective of regeneration? What type of architects do we want to be? And how can we do so in a healthy work culture? We want to explore a way of working that goes beyond the competitive model of individual success and soloist genius, towards one of collaboration around socio-ecological ambitions.This work conference marks the end of the 5-year term of Renske van der Stoep and Thijs van Spaandonk as heads of the Masters in Architecture and Urbanism and a celebration of the education programme they introduced, “Design for the Rotterdam Climate Reality”. It will also be used to discuss the future of education at the Rotterdam Academy of Architecture and Urbanism.Speakers (in English)Maria Lisogorskaya (Assemble)Maarten Gielen (Rotor) Winne van Woerden (Commons Network)Sessions (in English and Dutch)How to Cope (a group therapy)Building RitualsDesigners’ RebellionRedesign the SchoolAfter Ego ArchitectureJoin us for a full day including a vegetarian lunch from our neighbours Chinny and a shrub from Fat Blake.

Ontwerpers en andere actoren in de productie van de gebouwde omgeving spelen hierin een belangrijke rol en zijn mede verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen van een alternatieve bouwpraktijk die de negatieve tendensen weet om te buigen.Op zaterdag 24 juni gaan we in gesprek over nieuwe rollen die architecten en stedenbouwkundigen kunnen en moeten oppakken. Hoe kunnen we werken aan een andere planologie, ontwerpcultuur en bouwpraktijk? Hoe kunnen we bijvoorbeeld gebouwen een positieve footprint geven en voorkomen dat we in een totale CO2-lockdown terechtkomen? Hoe kunnen we de gebouwde omgeving ontwikkelen op basis van regeneratieve uitgangspunten? Wat voor ontwerpers willen we zijn? En hoe kunnen we een gezonde werkcultuur ontwikkelen? We streven naar een werkwijze die het competitieve model van individueel succes en het solistische genie achterlaat en samenwerking rond sociaal-ecologische ambities centraal stelt.Deze werkconferentie markeert de afsluiting van de vijfjarige termijn van Renske van der Stoep en Thijs van Spaandonk als hoofden van de masteropleidingen Architectuur en Stedenbouw en een viering van het onderwijsprogramma ‘Ontwerpen aan de Rotterdamse Klimaatopgaven’, waartoe zij de aanzet hebben gegeven.

Floatation Tank : Book your session!,"As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, you can experience John C.

These limits are to be discovered experientially and experimentally. When so determined these limits are found to be further beliefs to be transcended.’*As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, we are proud to offer visitors the opportunity to personally experience John C. Lilly's tank isolation technique. The original concept was devised by John Lilly as a research instrument in 1954. In the ensuing decades, Lilly would go on to simplify and perfect the solitude, isolation and confinement tank, making it safer to build and use even for those untrained in this kind of research. The floatation tank that is available for visitors to use was inspired by Lilly's original tank designs. The floatation tank is a medium for process. It removes 99% of sensory input sources, assisting the user in cultivating an awareness of their internal state of being and attuning to their senses within and without the tank. Similar to meditation, many people enter into a relationship with sensory deprivation practices with certain expectations about what is going to happen. 'All we can say to these people is — nothing will happen that you don’t already know about; nothing can happen that you will not allow to happen, i.e.: “What is forbidden is not allowed.”' The possibilities for application of the tank isolation technique are multiple, ranging from simple relaxation in the weightlessness of the salt solution, pain relief for individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and psychonautic exploration of consciousness, with many certainly yet to be discovered. The relative lack of contemporary awareness of and research into sensory deprivation is partially due to the inaccessibility of the medium to the public. Floatation centres are scarce and expensive. Especially centres that endeavour to create an environment conducive to exploration, experimentation and reflection are lacking. West hopes to become such an environment throughout the exhibition of the floatation tank, providing an (albeit temporary) embryonic escape through sensory deprivation from life in a cultural climate characterised by flagrant overstimulation. An impossible space for self-interrogation of The Deep Self. * John C. Lilly (1915-2001), The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, (Distributor).What to consider before booking a timeslot You will be in an enclosed space in the absence of light and sound for +/- 1 hour, so if you are claustrophobic or fear the dark this is something to consider. However, as there is no light influx whatsoever in the tank, the inside appears more spacious to the user than it is in reality. This often negates feelings of claustrophobia. Even if you are claustrophobic, please feel free to come give it a try. Your session can be stopped at any time if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. You will be suspended in a solution of Water, Magnesium Sulfate, and Hydrogen peroxide (<100ppm), and Sodium Citrate, maintained around 33-34 degrees Celsius (skin temperature). The solution has a neutral pH, compatible with that of human skin. The solution is filtered and treated between each user.However, if any of the following apply to you, we recommend you do not participate in this installation:You have open wounds anywhere on your body. This includes conditions such as scalp eczema, skin ulcers or athlete’s foot. This if for your own wellbeing (seeing as the highly dense salt solution will sting quite a bit on open or irritated skin) and for the wellbeing of subsequent users of the floatation tank. The same naturally applies to any other infectious diseases.You are currently menstruating, are easily susceptible to urinary tract infections, or are in the process of healing from gender-affirming surgery. If you are pregnant, please consult your physician before booking a session.You suffer from diarrhoea or gastroenteritis/are living with bladder or bowel incontinence.You have low blood pressure.You are epileptic.You are diagnosed with an acute psychological/psychiatric condition. Please consult your respective mental health professional here, do your research and use your best judgement.Any questions about particular conditions’ compatibility (such as specific physical disabilities) with floatation therapy can be directed towards the contact listed at the end of this information sheet. We strongly discourage any visitors from entering the tank under the influence of any and all mind-altering substances (excluding prescription medications taken under the supervision of a medical professional). If the host is under the impression that you are in any way inebriated you will not be allowed inside the tank and your participation fee will not be refunded. The risks of this far outweigh whatever rewards you might have read about. The tank is wheelchair accessible. Please be advised that you will be required to sign a liability waiver before entering the tank.

More than 220 million students study at some 23,000 higher education institutions worldwide. Universities are the single most important source of basic research worldwide, while at the same time educating millions for increasingly knowledge-based economies. The higher education enterprise has undergone dramatic and unprecedented change in the past 70 years—going from a relatively small elite sector to educating more than 70 percent of young people in wealthy countries and a third or more in most of the rest of the world. Massification has been the hallmark of higher education worldwide. At the same time, the global knowledge economy depends on universities for research, communication, and education.

Regulating Risks in the Energy Transition — Dealing with Uncertainty,A high-level conference on how governments should address questions of uncertainty when regulating risks in the energy transition.,2023-07-05 09:00,2023-07-05 17:00,"Amare - Den Haag,150 Spuiplein 2511 DG Den Haag Netherlands",The Hague,TRUE,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/regulating-risks-in-the-energy-transition-dealing-with-uncertainty-tickets-623719731507,,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/CTC-Scraper-GPT-Live/CSV URL Data/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_amsterdam.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/oecd-and-netherlands-ministry-of-economic-affairs-and-climate-policy-64891441513,"The Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are organising a conference on the role of the precautionary principle in the energy transition and on regulating the risks of hydrogen. The day will be opened by the Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy Policy, Rob Jetten, and other speakers include high-level officials of the OECD and the European Commission. There will also be talks and workshops from senior representatives from government and academia. This event marks the conclusion of the EC DG REFORM funded TSI project “Precaution in the Energy Transition and Improved Knowledge for Hydrogen Risk Regulation.” The conference will take place in The Hague on the 5th of July 2023 in the brand-new Amare building and aims at presenting and disseminating main findings and recommendations of the OECD Project. The theme deals with important questions for the success of the energy transition. To successfully carry out the energy transition, inevitable risks that come with it need to be appropriately regulated. How should governments deal with questions of uncertainty, risk and precaution in regulating new energy technologies? This is the main question that will be addressed.  The day will also include practical discussions. For example, how to use recent tools and guidelines and the perspective of local administrators. The morning will be devoted to presentations and a panel discussion which focus on uncertainty in the energy transition with an emphasis on hydrogen risk regulation throughout. The afternoon will be filled with workshops on the following topics: hydrogen risk, precaution and uncertainty, tools for local political governance, risk policy principles, and learning from incidents. Each workshop will be given twice to give participants the opportunity to attend multiple.If you are interested to attend this event, please register for a free ticket on this page.There will be five workshops in the afternoon to go deeper into the issues. Each will be given twice, so you have the opportunity to attend two of them. In the registration form, please inform us of all the workshops you would like to attend, we will allocate them accordingly.Here is a short introduction to the workshops to help you select the ones that interest you most. Learning from IncidentsTransitions, such as the energy transition, require good legislation. Make laws and rules for the long term. Make room for learning, evaluation and experimentation. Dare to question existing systems. In this way, there is more room during implementation to respond quickly to all the new and uncertain aspects that occur in transitions.At the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, the Dutch Council for Public Administration issued an advisory paper on learning in transitions. The advice addresses the question of how learning in transitions is possible, without immediately wanting to cover every risk with new laws and regulations.The Council advises on the basis of principles of good public administration: the rule of law, democracy and administrative capacity. In transitions, things happen unintentionally, so it is necessary to create space for learning, and that sets requirements on public administration. Such as room to make mistakes and learn by trial and error: in other words to stumble and fall, get up again and keep on going.Moderator: Peter Verheij (member Dutch Council for Public Administration)Dutch Risk Policy Principles for the Energy TransitionThe energy transition needs urgent action, but our present system of regulating risk in the Netherlands is not always adequately suited to its innovative character.The Dutch Cabinet will in 2023 present a set of policy principles to deal responsibly with safety and health risks and accelerate the energy transition equally. These principles combine a continuation of good old practices (such as risk and knowledge based approach) with constructive and sound earlier advises, which have not been implemented yet. Additional new elements intend to make the risk approach more compatible with the innovative technologies that come with the energy transition.The risk policy principles, as well as the ideas and discussions surrounding them, will be explained by their developers from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management: Jan van Tol, Jos Benner and Rob Smal.Tools for Local Political governanceAny administrator or public representative who must make decisions about new projects for the energy transition will be familiar with this dilemma: the energy transition is necessary due to, among other things, the significant risk of climate change. But inevitably, as with any human activity, new technology will also introduce new risks. How do we decide what new risks are acceptable and which approach to the precautionary principle is suitable? A group of Dutch mayors, aldermen and provincial authorities, the working group for a safe energy transition (Bestuurlijk Overleg voor een Veilige Energietransitie in Nederland, BOVEN) believes that integral decision making is the way forward. This means taking both the positive and the negative risks of new technology into the equation. As an aid by that effort a new tool for local decision makers has been developed, the “risk mixing console”. This enables the comparison of existing and new safety and health risks using as common denominator the WHO disability adjusted life year (DALY).In this workshop the challenge for local authorities and the use of the risk mixing console will be discussed. Moderator: Ira Helsloot (professor Governance of Safety and Security, Radboud University)Hydrogen Risk RegulationThis work centres around dealing with risk uncertainty when adopting a new technology, hydrogen as a common based fuel and energy source, where there is an absence of agreed and shared understanding of the hazards and risks – even when the benefits of this technology are accepted. In response to global energy pressures and the urgent need to tackle climate many governments have set out ambitious energy transition policies and plans but delivering these changes into local communities has become a challenge in the light of uncertainty about the risks. The workshop will explore the dynamics of risk based regulation and societal acceptance of these new technologies.Moderator: Ian TraversUncertainty and Precaution in the Energy TransitionInformation to follow, check back soon.",

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals. The School of Life’s drive to spread greater self-awareness and The Humblebrag’s action-oriented courses make for a perfect combination to support the next generations of agenda-setting change-makers.

The film shows the struggle of Kiribati’s president, Ton, against the backdrop of UN climate negotiations in Paris. This is dramatically strung through a telling of the personal story of Tiemeri, a mother of six who is trying everything she can to ensure that she and her family can move to safety in New Zealand.The film screening will be followed by a special Hague Talks and discussion where we will delve into the topic of ecocide, environmental justice, and how Mozambique and its Chief Justice is working to secure a more just future for its people.About the speakers: Jojo Mehta, a Co-Founder and Executive Director of Stop Ecocide International. Jojo has been at the forefront of the movement to establish ecocide as a crime at the International Criminal Court.

DescriptionThe VSR, the Dutch and Flemish Law and Society association, has existed since 1980 and is an association for researchers and practicing lawyers who themselves conduct research in the field of the empirical workings of law or are interested in it. During our annual two-day conference researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds (sociologists of law, legal anthropologists, legal psychologists, public administration experts and criminologists) present their findings. See the VSR website for more details about its structure and goals.The theme for this year's Annual Conference is: The Next Generation.Society as a whole is faced with challenges on how to move further and how to ensure the next generation can thrive. Topics such as the climate crisis, migration, democratic backsliding, the role of technology are just a few of the pressing issues we are faced with. The Next Generation also means pushing boundaries, employing different approaches and creating space for junior academics and those voices in academia who do not always get the same space. All themes will be running throughout the whole conference. Our keynote speaker pushes boundaries with her approach to research, we want to connect scholars who have something to offer and those who seek help via Academic Speed Dating and create space for voices in academia who do not always get the same platform as others.There will be a conference fee to pay for food and drinks (tea and coffee, lunch and one reception with snacks included) during the conference. As a participant you can sign up for the conference dinner as well.

In conversation with Christina Brophy.P﻿LEASE NOTE: This free event is first come, first served; RSVPs are encouraged. Seating is limited. Doors open at 5:30 pm. Can't attend? Preorder your signed copy here.Fueled by an abiding concern with environmental crisis for more than three decades, contemporary artist Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) depicts an ominous and complex vision of ocean life affected by humankind in a monumental new series titled Oceanus. Alexis Rockman: Oceanus takes the viewer on a global journey of discovery beneath the world's changing seas, through the artist's ethereal and sublime renderings of real and imaginary marine life within a fragile ecosystem. Published to accompany an ambitious traveling exhibition in North America and abroad, this volume documents Rockman's newly executed 8 x 24-foot panoramic painting Oceanus and ten related large watercolors, important works that tell the story of humanity's indelible relationship with the ocean and the connections between the sea and our own survival, as the artist deftly weaves natural history, art history, archaeology, adventure, political analysis, and science into a story about the human condition. Complementing this stunning presentation of Rockman's paintings--as well as many details and photographs documenting the artist's process, along with a rich selection of contextual imagery--are essays by leading writers and scholars on such topics as maritime and oceanic history and Rockman's work within the larger context of art history.
Alexis Rockman is a contemporary American painter known for his fantastical paintings of dystopian natural environments. Rockman tackles ecological issues—such as climate change and species extinction—through his large-scale artworks. Part-artist, part-activist, he confronts pressing social issues head on through carefully rendered paintings of animals and their rapidly changing environments.Christina Brophy is Senior Director of Museum Galleries and Senior Vice President of Curatorial Affairs at the Mystic Seaport Museum.",

We will chat a little about seaweed restoration, remediation, and water quality. But mostly, we want you to feel how nice it is to be on the water. How amazing it would be if it were clean and we, the public, had access to be on it.  There will be a short ladder to climb down to the canoes.

Wear sunscreen. Sunglasses/sun hats are recommended. All attendees must fill out a waiver.Seaweed City is a collaborative project led by Shanjana Mahmud and Luke Eddins.

Flushing Creek was artificially forced underground at sections into pipes for the construction of the 1939 World’s Fair grounds and now runs beneath and through the center of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Daylighting, or restoring underground portions of a waterway into above ground habitats, has immense benefits for social-ecological health and climate resilience.Organized by Guardians of Flushing Bay together with artist and educator Julia Norton, each of the four workshops in this series will be led by a different Queens-based artist selected through an open call. Some workshops will move through the park to examine Flushing Creek first hand, while others will remain in the museum to consider the waterway more broadly. The workshops will allow for exploration within a variety of artistic mediums, such as conceptual practice and hands-on art making. The goal of the workshops is to reveal Flushing Creek through visual materials and content that can be utilized in engaging local park users in the future possibility of daylighting Flushing Creek. These workshops will be designed for adults ages 18 and older. Any minors older than 12 are welcome to participate, but must be accompanied by an adult. All participants should be prepared for uneven terrain, long outdoor walks and muddy conditions. No prior experience is necessary.",

Globally, there are around 100 million people without homes and 1.6 billion people living in unsuitable housing conditions. And these numbers are continually rising. The pandemic, migration, and the climate crisis have and will continue to have a negative influence on the rising number of the unhoused. In addition to economic and social measures, a notably significant factor is the environment in which the socially marginalized live. An important component of any interdisciplinary team, therefore, must include architects.What is the situation in the Czech Republic and in European cities? And what role do architects have in improving the situation? What innovative approaches can be used to integrate people with experience of homelessness back into society? The lecture will include a screening of three short films about selected projects from the Architecture of Coexistence series (by Architects without Borders, Czechia and artyčok.TV): Bedřiška, Ostrava (Czechia), VinziRast-mittendrin, Vienna (Austria), Bellevue di Monaco, Munich (Germany).Ing. arch. Karolína Kripnerová, Ph.D.

is an architect interested in the social overlaps of architecture. She lectures, writes articles and moderates discussions on topics such as public space, homelessness and affordable housing. She is co-founder of the nonprofit Architects without Borders, Czechia. She teaches at the Faculty of Architecture at the Czech Technical University in Prague and works in the Kazimour Kripnerová architekti studio.

Lalela Ulwandle: Listen to the Sea,A research-based theatre project that explores the relationship between humans and the ocean in South Africa,2023-06-12 19:00,2023-06-12 21:00,"176 Saint Nicholas Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11237",New York,FALSE,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lalela-ulwandle-listen-to-the-sea-tickets-640416953347,,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/CTC-Scraper-GPT-Live/CSV URL Data/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_nyc.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/empatheatre-65335568793,"Lalela uLwandle is a research-based theatre project that makes visible stories of living with the ocean that are seldom seen or heard in the public domain. Lalela uLwandle means “Listen to the Sea” in isiZulu. At some point in our lives, many of us have picked up a large shell and placed it against our ears to hear the sound of the oceans within it. It is this image that we invoke in this project, of standing quietly on the beach and listening to the stories of the ocean, and the people who have an intimate relationship with it. Weaving the stories, histories and contemporary concerns of diverse South African coastal communities into an Empatheatre production, Lalela uLwandle explores themes of intergenerational environmental injustices, tangible and intangible ocean heritage, marine science and the myriad threats to ocean health.The performance sheds new light and hope on some of the well-known conundrums of ocean governance. Most noticeably it has surfaced intangible heritages of the ocean, and challenged evidence hierarchies in local law and international policy. Recently the audio play of Lalela uLwandle was used as evidence (along with two other short films from Empatheatre) in three court proceedings in legal cases against Oil and Gas giant Shell and the South African government in 2022. The play, was used as evidence to support the rich and powerful affidavits of small scale fishers and other ocean defenders in the case. This was the first time in SA history, that art was used as evidence in ocean governance, and found ways to represent indigenous intangible heritage in meaningful and inclusive ways. One of the most significant aspects of the play illustrates how natural and social scientists can collaborate with holders of different knowledge systems, respectfully and constructively, to develop a more integrated understanding of environmental challenges. The play also illuminates the close connections between human rights and ocean-climate governance, from the local to the international level. There will be a discussion with the audience after the performance, in which we look forward to engaging with different policy makers and publics, experts and stakeholders. During these discussions, we think critically about the importance of listening to and mutual learning among researchers, spiritual healers, small-scale fishers and other stakeholders, and how this can transform the way we understand unexplored connections to the ocean and its role in climate governance.  Lalela uLwandle is an invitation to a participatory public conversation on ocean governance in South Africa. It is funded under the One Ocean Hub, a five-country hub of researchers exploring more democratic methods of engagement in ocean governance.

Quantifying ESG Risk,This in-person conversation will provide valuable insights into the rapidly growing field of ESG Risk and its impact on the emerging world.,2023-06-01 17:15,2023-06-01 19:45,"New York City Bar Association,42 West 44th Street New York, NY 10036",New York,FALSE,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/quantifying-esg-risk-tickets-630970659227,,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/CTC-Scraper-GPT-Live/CSV URL Data/climate_tech_eventbrite_climate_nyc.csv,https://www.eventbrite.com/o/prmia-61381240913,"The world has come to recognize the impact of ESG issues on an entity’s financial health and viability. As ESG issues become increasingly pertinent to both the developed and the emerging world, there is a greater need to quantity risk(s) emanating from company operations and developing tools to measure and manage ESG risks. Since the materiality of ESG issues differs by industry, a common quantification system to compare entity performance on ESG parameters is the need of the hour. This is important to have cross-entity evaluation as well. Quantifying ESG risk involves understanding relevant ESG factors for an entity, understanding each factor’s importance for the entity, assigning weights based on the importance, and then scoring an entity’s initiatives and measures to mitigate the ESG risk. The approach to quantify ESG risk works like a common currency to compare entities on a uniform scale and provide a quick idea about their management of ESG issues.

Their survival is largely due to Ray, a brilliant scientist who designed a domed structure with all the systems necessary to sustain life on a planet that could no longer support it. Their custom biosphere is outfitted with basic necessities and creature comforts that make it possible to retain a sense of what life used to be like. A hydroponic garden provides fresh vegetables and a carefully managed fishpond supplies essential protein. Recently, however, fish have begun dying at an alarming rate. With a mere three fish remaining, Billy and Ray face an ominous future.

Though it is often framed in abstract terms—warming scenarios, emissions pathways, integrated assessment models for damages, and fuel mixes in the grid—it is rarely experienced this way. Rather, the global energy transition and the broader struggle for climate justice are often understood—and thus won or lost—in materialist terms: through investments in the buildings, landscapes, public works, and built environment that stitch together everyday life for most people. This is the proposition at the core of Green New Dealers’ program—to transform how and where we live and relate to one other by tackling carbon emissions and inequality at once. But these forces extend well beyond the boundaries of a parcel of building envelope where designers typically engage with questions of climate action. The technologies at the core of the energy transition—solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, battery farms, data centers, and advanced nuclear power—all depend on a planetary supply matrix of rare earth elements and critical minerals. These pockets of exceedingly valuable ore tend to be developed in the Global South—and especially in the most remote locations of the Global South, where rules, laws, and norms can be suspended or ignored by multinational mining companies without the scrutiny of local or international press. The poles of this process—the mines and the end-use technological deployments—are linked through a network of waste disposal sites, manufacturing hubs, renewable energy deployment zones, and the various labor and logistical forces that make them all possible.  One of those poles rests in South Greenland’s Kvanefjeld Mine—an erstwhile uranium mine that was key to the Allies’ postwar nuclear energy and weapons programs, that was subsequently decommissioned after decades of anti-mining militancy by a local group of Inuit activists known as Urani? Naamik! (Uranium? No thanks!). But prospectors have since discovered that the mine is home to the world’s second-densest deposit of rare earth elements and critical minerals that, coupled with Greenland’s postcolonial relationship with Denmark, and the region has entered a state of suspended reality as interested parties wait for the Danish court system to rule on exploitation licenses for the site. This lecture will situate Greenland within the global energy transition and implicate its future in that of the Global North. Put another way, this lecture will ask what it means for resource communities like Narsaq, Greenland for the U.S. and other imperial powers to pursue the kind of resource-intensive energy transition that is now underway. “Fire, Ice, and Ore” is presented as part of e-flux Architecture Lectures, a monthly series inviting researchers and practitioners to discuss timely issues in contemporary architecture, theory, culture, and technology.Billy Fleming is the founding Wilks Family Director of the Ian L. McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design. He is a co-founder of the Climate + Community Project—a climate justice think tank dedicated to connecting movement demands and progressive legislators through applied research—and co-creator of the organization Data Refuge—an international initiative to secure critical environmental data at risk of erasure during the Trump Administration. His work includes the recent books A Blueprint for Coastal Adaptation with Carolyn Kousky and Alan Berger, and Design With Nature Now with Frederick Steiner, Richard Weller, and Karen M’Closkey. Billy’s writing and scholarship have appeared in Dissent, The Guardian, Washington Post, New York Times, Places Journal, and Journal of Architectural Education, among others. His current book project is titled Building Just, Post-Carbon Futures: Imagining and Implementing Climate Justice in America and is expected in 2024.For more information, contact program@e-flux.com.Accessibility					 –Two flights of stairs lead up to the building’s front entrance at 172 Classon Avenue.		  –For elevator access, please RSVP to program@e-flux.com.

In a theater in New York City, seven teens gather to put on a play because our world is burning and they have something to say about it. In this visceral and confronting new play, a cast of teenagers grapple with the realities of the world they are inheriting, hold the audience to account, and imagine new pathways forward together. Directed by Nick J. Browne with original music by Curtis Gillen, Is My Microphone On? is inspired by Greta Thurnberg and the tenacity of youth across the globe who are taking a stand for themselves and future generations. With music, confronting dialogue, and poetic language this play is a platform for the youth of New York to lift their voices, inspire dialogue regarding the climate crisis, and investigate how to heal a burning world if those in positions of power refuse to wake up and enact meaningful change now.

Rae Kelliher is a veteran environmental activist and pioneer in the death-with-dignity movement. Facing a diagnosis of terminal illness, she engages in a shocking suicide murder, taking the life of an oil company CEO for his role in delaying responses to climate disruption. Seven years later, Rae’s friends and family gather at her Vermont farm community to try to understand her violent exit and the rapid social transformations around them.I Want a Better CatastropheWith global warming projected to rocket past the 1.5°C limit, lifelong activist Andrew Boyd is thrown into a crisis of hope, and off on a quest to learn how to live with the “impossible news” of our climate doom. He searches out eight leading climate thinkers — from collapse-psychologist Jamey Hecht to grassroots strategist adrienne maree brown, eco-philosopher Joanna Macy, and Indigenous botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer — asking them: “Is it really the end of the world? and if so, now what?”About the Festival:Named after the sixth mass extinction event currently underway, the Sixth Fest has put on more than 40 events and productions in New York, Chicago, and online. From poetry to panels, pageants to protests, we are a fringe festival both in that we encourage people to create their own events, and that those events can be of whatever kind.

Trapped together in dystopia, they explore the meaning of their lives together through imagination, play, and reminiscences of the past. It is a play about human resilience, love and hate, isolation and friendship, environmental collapse, and of course, recycling.Debating Extinctiona new play by Padraig Bonddirected by Padraig Bondstarring Penelope Deen, Kristen Hoffman, and Tibor LazarDebating Extinction is a bold romance about the modern question of whether or not to have children in the face of the climate crisis. Susan and Teddy are young lovers living post climate change, and are preparing to have a child to restart humanity, but they must keep it secret from Susan’s tyrannical, yet deeply environmentalist mother.

Curated by Amanda + James in partnership with Asia Stewart, The third iteration of Summer happenings is centered on the theme of coastlines.Too often, many of us rush through New York City and forget that we live on a series of islands whose natural landscape has been adapted and shaped by generations of forgotten inhabitants.  We neglect our land’s past: the violence that resides in soil stolen from the Lenape people (including the Wappinger, Munsee Lenape, Schaghticoke, Canarsie, Matinecock, and Lekawe nations). We look past the waterways’ paths; many brush up against terminals, docks, and piers and have been constructed for and destroyed by cycles of trade, capital, and exchange. As coastal living becomes increasingly precarious with climate change, we hope you will consider the history, value, beauty, and fragility of our brackish borders. Our presence here is not neutral.",

Our goal is clear: together, we need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and stop burning fossil fuels. And we need to do this in a way that is equitable and just. Any one of the thousands of jobs that help with that is a climate career! You could focus on reducing GHG emissions in buildings - working in designing, construction, or clean energy. Or you could manage green space, by working in natural areas or agriculture. You might help us move toward “circularity” - reducing waste through repairing goods or reusing materials. Or you may help your community be more resilient. This means reducing peoples’ vulnerability to climate hazards.  Maybe you want to be an educator and teach people about climate change, or you love economics and want to help finance solutions. Maybe you’ll invent a solution no one knows about yet!  Whatever your interests, there is a climate career path for you. Participating Organizations We'll have representatives from over 20 different organizations, all focused on environment, climate, or green industries. Come learn about the different opportunities available in the NYC area and speak to workers who are taking climate action in their jobs!Student-Led WorkshopsW﻿e have optional, student-led workshops:Climate Communications in Your School Upcycling Workshop W﻿e'll also have a keynote speaker to talk about being a young climate professional, and activities like an eco-book swap!

The session will also provide strategies to share climate communication with your colleagues.  Workshop 3:  Climate Education Advocacy 101 Develop your advocacy skills by refining a “pitch” to use at your own school to advance climate education. Learn the four key “asks” that the Advocacy subcommittee of CELT has identified, and the climate education goals in the Mayor’s recent PlaNYC. We will practice using advocacy skills in activities with your students and Green Teams turning our goals into actions!

Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.

            Climate LIVE K12: Harnessing the Power of Communities to Fight Flooding and Protect Our Waterways 
Climate LIVE K12 (formerly EI LIVE K12) is dedicated to bringing the science of sustainability to K12 students, educators, and parents.
About this Event 
Presenter:  Paul Gallay, Senior Staff Associate and Resilient Coastal Communities Project Leader, Center for Sustainable Urban Development 
Target Audience: Grades 9-12, Undergraduate, Educators, and the Public 
Climate-driven flooding is worsening due to sea level rise and rapidly intensifying storms, with many of the most serious impacts being felt in disadvantaged communities already reeling from decades of underinvestment in water quality and ecosystem health. To protect our most vulnerable communities, government planners must find new ways to respect and center the wisdom that only those communities possess. Can we build the just and equitable partnerships we'll need to survive climate change?
A link to join the session will be provided to all registered participants 24 hours in advance.

While federal resources are critical for providing relocation support to thousands of people living in the U.S., national policies and programs are falling short in addressing the urgency, scale, and complexity of climate-driven displacement. When it comes to buyouts and property acquisitions, accessing federal funds poses significant challenges. Restrictive requirements and lengthy bureaucratic processes can hinder local governments from developing compassionate and locally-responsive programs that prioritize community needs. To overcome these hurdles, local governments can leverage local funding sources to reduce their reliance on federal disaster dollars. By diversifying funding sources, local governments can not only expand relocation assistance beyond individual home buyouts, but also align their programs with local values and broader resilience goals.
Join us for an engaging conversation as we explore innovative approaches and tools for local governments and communities to overcome equity and implementation challenges associated with federal disaster resources. In this webinar, moderated by Urban Ocean Lab (UOL), our panel of experts, including representatives from local governments and nonprofits, will share valuable insights from their experiences on leveraging local funding sources for more just and holistic approaches to climate-driven relocation.
This virtual panel is presented by Urban Ocean Lab, in partnership with Columbia University's Climate School as part of the 2023 conference At What Point Managed Retreat?: Habitability and Mobility in an Era of Climate Change

As the world transitions from consuming fossil fuels-based energy into low-carbon energy sources, demand for copper, lithium, nickel, and other minerals will increase for things like electric mobility, solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage. However, the world is not on track to get these minerals at current rates. The world’s demand for lithium is projected to increase by 40 times and that for copper to potentially double by 2040 relative to 2020 levels. 
Latin America has the world’s largest deposits of both copper and lithium. Chile and Peru are the world’s leading copper producers with about 40% of global production, while Chile and Argentina account for 32% of global lithium supply. However, Latin America faces a number of social, political, environmental, and financial challenges to increase its critical minerals extraction and processing capacity. 
The Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs will host a panel of experts to discuss what needs to be done to accelerate sustainable copper and lithium extraction in Latin American countries. This event will focus on the challenges and opportunities that governments and industry face to turn these mineral reserves into a bridge for the energy transition globally. Light refreshments will be provided.

María José Baptista, Interagency and Intergovernmental Affairs Officer, United Nations Environment Programme
Juan Carlos Jobet, Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy  at Columbia University SIPA; Dean, School of Business, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez; Former Minister of Energy and Mining, Chile
